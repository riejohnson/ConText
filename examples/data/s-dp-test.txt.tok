  This spectacular film is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen . It shows a China I had never seen or imagined , and I believe it shows 1930 's China in the most REAL light ever seen in a movie . It is absolutely heart-breaking in so many situations , seeing how hard life was for the characters , and yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful . You truly see the depths and heigths of human existence in this film . The actors are all perfect , such that you feel like you have really entered a different world . I simply can not recommend this movie highly enough . It may just change you forever once you have seen it .  
  This is a lot of silliness about a woman from London who marries a tea planter from Ceylon whom she barely knows . It 's full of cliches , and the Liz Taylor character is not believable . It has a marvelous set , some exotic location footage . It shows Taylor at the height of her beauty . She looks stunning .  
  Shinjuku Triad Society : Chinese Mafia Wars is unlikely to get distribution in the West outside film festivals . Why ? Could your censors stomach a film where policemen anally rape male and female suspects to get them to talk ( and the victims enjoy it ) or see an old lady have her eye torn out of her skull ? These are just a few of the shocks in store for viewers of this ultraviolent cops and gangsters story . It makes Clockwork Orange which was banned for years in the UK look like a Disney cartoon . Should you see this film ? YES It is fantastic and essential viewing for fans of Asian cinema . The shocking moments are there to illustrate what goers on in the world of these characters . If you like this make sure you catch Dead or Alive which is very similar ( barring the insane ending in DOA of course ) . Great for Japan that they have a talent like Miike working at the same time as Takeshi Kitano . The best chance of seeing this film outside a Takashi Miike retrospective at a film festival is on DVD . If I haven't put you off try hunting for a Hong Kong version on the web as I 'm sure it will come out in that country .  
  Sure , this movie is sappy and sweet and full of clichés , but it 's entertaining , and that 's what I watch movies for . To be entertained . Natasha Henstridge is stunning , even with the short hair . Her smile is radiant and her beauty can't be disguised . As for Michael Vartan , I 'm sure the women love him . The two of them seemed to really like eacb other in this film . I don't understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them . I guess we see what we want to see . Olivia d'Abo and Michael Rigoli were fun to watch , even if d'Abo 's British accent did creep into her supposed Bronx speech . To tell you the truth I hadn't really noticed it until I read these comments , but I went back to the DVD and now her dialogue sounds more British than American to me , but she was ideal for her role with that one exception . It 's a story of two nice people who are getting married to significant others , but who find their soul mates in one another . It may be an unlikely story , but who says movies are all supposed to play like documentaries ? It is no more unrealistic than any of the dramas that are screened every hour on the tube . That 's why we watch them , to escape from the humdrum of daily living for a short time and enter the world of the characters on the screen . I thought these actors did a good job of it , but hey , I 'm a sentimental guy who tears up easily . Don't get me wrong though , it has to be a sentimental scene , and this movie had plenty of those . I give it 9/10 only because I 'm saving my 10/10 for that yet unseen super magnificent movie that I know will come along some day . If you see it advertised as coming up on the Movie Channel or Lifetime Movies , or whatever , make a note to watch it . I think you 'll like it .  
  A beautiful postcard of New York . The thing I enjoyed most was being able to watch this with my whole family and not cringe waiting for a stupid toilet humor joke to appear . It never did . My teenagers liked it too . My son for Natasha Henstridge and my daughter for Michael Vartan . My wife and I commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and ALL enjoy something . This film told a story that felt comfortable but not old or done . The ending came with a twist which we all liked too . If you are not just a cynical person and have are willing to let a story unfold then this is for you . As a guy it takes a lot to hold my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one did . I recommend it and we need more of these films to watch .  
  I have looked forward to seeing this since I first saw it listed in her work . Finally found it yesterday 2/13/02 on Lifetime Movie Channel . Jim Larson 's comments about it being a " sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths " were dead on . Writers probably shouldn't get a bonus , everyone else SRO for making the movie . Anybody who appreciates a romantic Movie SHOULD SEE IT . Natasha 's screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric , to say nothing of her beauty , that anything she is in goes on my favorite list . Her TV and print interviews that I have seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking for . God Bless her , her family and future endeavors . This movie doesn't seem to available in DVD or video yet , but I would be the first to buy it and I think others would too .  
  Here 's another movie that should be loaded into a satellite , fired into space and pointed in the direction of the galaxy Andromeda to show distant possible civilizations the best of humanity . This movie is so endearingly stupid and revealingly honest in being little more than a rip-off of the already bad movie classic KING KONG from 1976 that it not only manages to upstage that film in terms of sheer belly laugh idiotic goofiness , but successfully predicted much of Peter Jackson 's miserable 2005 computer cartoon bearing the same name , as far as a " romance " between the giant ( here a Yeti ) and a gorgeous human female ( Antonellina Interlenghi of Umberto Lenzi 's CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD , who is very easy on the eyes ) . The film was made for kids so aside from some innuendo over fish bones and a bizarre nipple tweak to say goodbye you can forget about sex - the Yeti even has a sort of giant jock strap to cover up his monstrous package , the result being even more amusing than anatomical correctness . But as a trade-off you DO get a wacky old scientist , two inquisitive kids , Tony Kendall in a rare turn as a duplicitous bastard of a villain , a helpful intelligent collie dog who gets to have her own adventure ( Dog Adventure movies were big in Europe for a while ) and of course emerges as the hero at the end for saving the Yeti , who turns out to be the good guy , glorious stuff like front end loaders decorated to look like giant ape hands , a monster who 's size literally changes scale from shot to shot , some inappropriately horrible deaths that will make the carnage in GODZILLA VS THE SMOG MONSTER look tame by comparison , crowd reaction shots a-plenty made up of either Spanish , Italian or Canadian extras depending upon scene ( you can sort of tell where they were shooting from how the extras are dressed ) , and some of the most enthusiastically staged but inept special effects work ever in a giant monkey movie . It 's here that the film won me over : It 's enthusiasm just for being made . Frank Kramer is actually the same Gianfranco Parolini who brought the world SARTANA in 1968 and GOD 'S GUN the year before this & was a very important director in the Spaghetti Western and action / adventure genre film scene from the 1960 's / 1970 's and by the time of YETI he was probably delighted to get the work . I would say that this is his most adventuresome movie ever , or rather the one he took the most chances with , and may have felt more comfortable taking those chances with the film aimed at kids & families . The movie has a kind of reckless abandon to the way it was made that renders the technical errors or inconsistencies totally meaningless . Or rather they are part of the fun , and if the movie had been played seriously it wouldn't have worked - WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY PETER JACKSON 'S MOVIE SUCKED . He forgot to have fun with the material and let it dictate the outcome using his army of stupid Power Macintosh pod people animators , and with all it 's faults + clunkiness , Kramer 's YETI is actually closer to the spirit of why we watch movies like this , which is partly to see actors in ape suits tearing apart miniature sets on sound stages , not seamlessly animated vapid hours of nothing other than hard drive space . I 'd rank this up there with KING KONG VERSUS GODZILLA and IT ! CURSE OF THE GREAT GOLEM as one of the most enjoyably improbable giant rampaging monster movies ever . Because the movie looks so " fake " you can get over the story and just have fun watching stuff get wrecked , trampled , tossed about and smashed . Knowing that and armed with a fertile , energetic enthusiasm for having the chance to make the movie , Parolini pulled out all the stops and delivers a full bodied adventure that might get a bit rough for some of the small tykes but is the first movie I will ever share with the grandkids someday when their stupid parents leave them with me for a weekend . This is stuff for the ages and one of the most telling expressions of humanity to ever be committed to celluloid . 10/10 , it 's about ten minutes too long but who cares , you only come around once and I 'd rather go out with a smile on my face .  
  I haven't always been a fan , but the show grew on me . It wasn't until after season 5 that I started to see the richness of the show . They finally brought Daniel Jackson 's search for his wife to an end and finally most of the Go , ould System Lords were killed by rival Lords , SG-1 or others . Towards Season 5 , Stargate SG-1 , was beginning to become stale . With the new writers and the close attention by Produer Peter Deleuise , the show became more and more solid . The characters had become stale as well . Colonel Jack O'Neill was the stereotypical hero with emotional baggage . After his son Charlie was killed in a shooting accident with O'Neill 's weapon , he had decided to end his own life by going to Abydos in order to face off with the Go'ould RA . The character offers little growth for any actor and actor Richard Dean Anderson chose to play him straight raising emotional barriers to protect himself . only allowing his close friends in . Amanda Tapping joined the cast as Captain Samantha Carter . She was a feminist on the edge , ready to battle any man who would doubt her ability to do her job . Though this character had little area to grow , Tapping has done a great job of concentrating on Carter 's strengths . She has taken the time to get a basic understanding of some of the things Carter talks about in order that she can present the character intelligently . Christopher Judge joined the cast playing the alien Teal'c . Teal'c was an alien called the Jaffa . Infant Go'ould , ( snake like creatures ) would embed themselves into the Jaffa until they had grown to the point when it would be inserted into another life form . The Jaffa would die . Teal'c was the First Prime of Apophis ' army . Knowing that Apophis was not a god like Go'ould pretend , he realized the genocide that their armies had wreaked on the galaxy . Finally , having had enough , he and Jack O'Neill freed their team along with quite a few innocent people . After arriving on Earth , he realized that Earth was the planet he was looking for , who would help him fight the Go'ould . Christopher Judge has done quite a bit with a limited character . Teal'c is a wise warrior , much of which he learned was from his teacher Master Bra'tac . The show would not be complete without Master Bra'tac played by Tony Amandola . He is also a rock . In the end , he became adviser to most of SG-1 , especially Daniel Jackson . Don S . Davil was there from the beginning playing Major General George Hammand . Davis has done an incredible job with Hammond making him sympathetic and normal . He does his job , has a wife , sons and daughters and grandchildren . You can really say , he is the anchor of the base . Simply , I would die for that man . If not allowed by his superiors to provide troops to support teams off world . He will go himself . He doesn't leave anyone behind . I saved Dr . Daniel Jackson for last , because this character , I believe has grown the most in the ten or eleven years it has been on . In choosing Shanks I don't think the producer realized how strong Shanks would be and now when people talk about Jackson , they don't talk about Spader , they talk about Shanks . In the early years , the Jackson character came off as a whiner . That 's why I probably wasn't a fan . As the seasons pasted , the character became stronger . This gave him confidence . In the end , as of season 10 , the Jackson character has matured to the point that he has become a self sacrificing hero . He still monitors the groups ethics . He still is lead at providing information that can move any mission forward . Acheaology , History , Culture and Exploration are part of his very being . He is determined . Though a man of peace , he has matured to the point that using his weapons may be the only way to solve a disagreement . Other characters include , most recently : Vala Mal Doran ( Claudia Black ) and Colonel Cameron Mitchell ( Ben Browder ) , new lead of SG-1 . Both actors come from a series called Farscape and why they were put together is any bodies guess . I see little difference between Mitchell and Crichton ( Farscape character ) . Black 's character is simply off the wall . Definitely different from her soldier like character Arin Soon .  
  " House Of Games " is definitely not without its flaws - plot holes , stiff acting , final scenes - but they do little to detract from the fun of watching a thriller that so methodically messes with your head . " House Of Games " does almost everything a good thriller is supposed to do . Of course , this is not a huge feat given the fact that we 're dealing with the the world of confidence men and the cons they perpetrate . So it stands to reason that we never really know what 's going on , even though we think that we do . But that 's what makes the film worthwhile for those who are game ; a film for which repeated viewings are indulgences instead if necessities . It has a definite Hitchcock slant to it . The film draws on some similar themes found his 1964 effort " Marnie " , considered a misfire when released but now regarded as one of the Master 's more thought-provoking works . One could easily consider the idea of Lindsay Crouse 's character being the same as Tippi Hedrin 's .. ten year later perhaps . Both are strong-willed loners , both with compulsive behaviors which compel them to walk too close to the shark pool . As Crouse 's repressed , up-tight character says , " What 's life without adventure ? " Put your Reality Check on a low setting and enjoy swimming with the sharks !  
  This is one of those movies that they did too much promoting for . If you watch T.V. , then you might as well not watch the movie . Almost all the funny scenes are spoiled in the previews , except one which just happens to be Jennifer Annisten being the funny one . It is typical Jim Carrey humor and it is really funny . Just don't go see this movie expecting to be surprised . All in all , if you like Jim Carrey or comedies this is a must-see , otherwise just watch the previews and you 'll be just as satisfied .  
  Ok , so it 's not a masterpiece like the Godfather , but it doesn't have to be . The only purpose this movie has is to make the viewer laugh several times . If it can make the viewer laugh a bunch of times , it has accomplished its purpose . I laughed out loud and left with a smile . I feel like I got my money 's worth .  
  I for one was glad to see Jim Carrey in a film where being over the top wasn't the goal . His character is like all of us . Wanting more - better things to happen to us and expecting God to deliver . Morgan Freeman made a great God . With a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us yet ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity presents itself . I thought Jennifer Aniston 's character was a little too vulnerable and understanding towards Carry 's basically self-centered TV anchorman wanna-be but that 's the way it was written . I think the previews ruined several potentially very funny scenes because everyone who saw them knew what was coming before it happened . I have read a number of the reviews and it seems some people are looking a little too deep . This is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the problems of the world although there are a few messages we could all take to heart . A funny film .  
  Wilhelm Grimm ( Alexander Knox ) stands trial for Nazi crimes . Three witnesses give evidence - Father Warecki ( Henry Travers ) , Wilhelm 's brother Karl ( Erik Rolf ) and Wilhelm 's former lover Marja ( Marsha Hunt ) - before Wilhelm speaks in his own defense . The film ends after the court sums up .. The film is told in three flashback segments as each of the witnesses takes the stand . The story is mostly set in a small Polish village and memorable scenes include the village reaction to the death of Anna ( Shirley Mills ) , who Wilhelm is accused of raping ; the treatment of the Jewish villagers as they prepare to be moved to concentration camps ; and the church service where Willie Grimm ( Richard Crane ) denounces his Nazi upbringing whilst mourning for his girlfriend Janina ( Dorothy Morris ) , Marja 's daughter , after she has been shot at a brothel . Throughout the film , Knox is unrepentant and is very convincing as a bitter , resentful and evil man . Martha Hunt has some powerful moments and matches him with her strength and Henry Travers is also very good in his role as a priest . This film delivers an effective story that stays with you once it has finished .  
  ROLL is a wonderful little film . Toby Malone plays an 18 year old kid ( very well acted , by the way ) who is into soccer . Malone 's cousin takes him out the night before his big game on an adventure with many twists and turns involving two gym bags , a drug lord , some tough bikers , some cops , and some prostitutes .. and the movie keeps us guessing as to which characters are on which side of the law , what the contents of either gym bag is , and even what gender a key biker is . Parts of it reminded me of LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING Barrels . For me , ROLL reinforced three opinions that I already held before seeing ROLL . Those opinions are : 1 . I really want to visit Australia one day . The country and cities are beautiful and it looks like such a cool place for a vacation . 2 . Some of the best filmmakers in the are Australian . The cinematography in ROLL was especially impressive . I loved the stylized colors and lighting in many of the scenes . 3 . Australian women are HOT !  
  American boy Jesse took the train to Vienna in order to take the plane for USA . On the train he met a French girl Celine . Although they met the first time , they talked like good friends . When the train stopped at Vienna , Jesse begged Celine to accompany him to have a tour on Vienna . Then the romantic story unfolded . At first they were cautious . The funniest scene was their listening to CD in music store . They peeked at each other , though their eyes did not contact . After in-depth conversation , they relationship became close . Then I saw the most romantic scene that they pretended to call their respective friend . Their deep love for each other was expressed completely by words . Love is a strange thing . When you really want it , it will not come as you wished . Love needs mutual understanding . Without it , love will not last long . Spiritual harmony is the most important for love . Excellent screenplay and performance resulted in huge success of the movie . One of the best romance movies . 9/10  
  This is a slow moving story . No action . No crazy suspense . No abrupt surprises . If you cannot stand to see a movie about two people just talking and walking , about a story that develops slowly till the very end and about lovey-dovey romance , don't waste your time and money . On the other hand , if you 're into dialog , masterful story telling , thought provoking ideas and finding true love in the fabric of life then this is your movie . I recommend you watch this movie when you are most alert , though , because the pace , the music and the overall tone of the movie can put you in a woolgathering mood . It 's truly fantastic . I really mean that . Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are annoying with their mannerisms at times but , thankfully , the chemistry between the two makes the acting very natural , warm and tender . They act and feel each other out from the very beginning , making you feel as an intruder . In their conversations there are excellent commentaries on many subjects that will provoke thought and conversation between you and your partner . I thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters but I may be underestimating their intelligence . Still it did not ruin the movie . The overall story is very simple which I think gives the movie it 's charm and ultimately it 's power . BOTTOM LINE : The movie 's flow is slow . The dialog is fascinating . The story builds gently , systematically and substantive . The build up to the finale is satisfying and in the end rewarding .  
  When I saw this movie in the theater when it came out in 1995 via a free advanced screening , I was totally enchanted and would have gladly paid to see it . I was sorry when I talked to many people afterwards who had also seen it and who were totally disappointed with it and how it ended . I , on the other hand , felt completely the opposite . I was totally satisfied with the outcome and everything else . People I talked to said there was too much talking ! Plus they were unhappy because they felt that the ending left you wondering about the fate of the two characters . I found these observations to be absurd and to also be painful evidence of how the majority of the American movie-going public seems to have a tendency to want easy-to-follow stories in films with not too much complex and intelligent dialogue lest they get confused . They also like to be spoon-fed tidy endings-happy OR sad . This disgusts me . Nobody wants to be challenged anymore ? And as for the ending ( and I don't want to be a spoiler ) , I am totally content because I know in my heart that these two characters WILL see each other again . It 's all about your own personal faith in romance and destiny . It 's a very personal film that doesn't speak to all people . But it certainly spoke to me . Give it a chance ! Be patient with it ! Richard Linklater has crafted a very lovely film with a beautiful story set against the beautiful background of the city of Vienna . Watching it makes you feel as if you yourself are strolling through the city streets along with the characters . As if you yourself were tripping through Europe on a Eurail pass . It 's very intimate . Plus , Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy do an exquisite job of bringing the complex script to life . They must have improvised during some parts and it works well . They have a great chemistry in their roles . Their awkwardness as strangers getting to know each other in the beginning is very believable and you can truly feel the romance and bonding develop between them as the movie progresses . I get the feeling that this was a very personal work for Mr . Linklater and I deeply respect him for getting this film made . It definitely touched me and I hope it touches others just as much . Bravo for romance !  
  " Before Sunrise " is a wonderful love story and has to be among my Top 5 favorite movies ever . Dialog and acting are great . I love the characters and their ideas and thoughts . Of course , the romantic Vienna , introduced in the movie does not exist ( you won't find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night ) and it isn't possible to get to all the places in only one night , either ( especially if you 're a stranger and it 's your first night in Vienna ) . But that 's not the point . The relationship of the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic . Although , nothing ever really happens , the movie never gets boring . The ending is genuinely sad without being " Titanic " or something . Even if you don't like love stories you should watch this film ! I 'm a little skeptic about the sequel that is going to be released in summer . The first part is perfect as it is , in my opinion .  
  I want Céline and Jessie go further in their relationship , I want to tell them that they were made for each other , that in a lot of moment in the film we want they to die for each other . Their story is what we ever wanted and probably most of us never reached . This is about love but not stupid things like in " notting hills " or those kind of movie . This is life and i did believe in them , i did believe they were falling .. This was so clever and touching . I have just finished to view it a minute ago and i m still there .. I want to go to Vienna . I want to see them as soon as possible again . I have to say i was now becoming misanthropist and felt like if love was just a fake , a concept , but with this movie i realized that maybe somewhere , somehow and some when , something could really happen . I 'm french and didn't know very well July Delpy despite Kieslowski " three colors : white " .. Now i have to see her other works because she looks like an angel and got a perfect acting . i saw " before sunset " ( the sequel in Paris ) a few days before i saw " before sunrise " and their is no matter . They are both masterpieces . proof that you don't need to impress the eyes with technology to get pure feelings . I 'm sorry for my English which i m trying to best . Franck in France  
  I was so impressed with Doug McGrath 's film version of the Jane Austen novel " Emma , " and I loved the music score by Rachel Portman so much , that when I went to the video store one day and discovered the two had re-united for " Nicholas Nickleby " I immediately rented it without any other consideration . I have read the book , and for those overly-critical fans of this Jane Austen adaptation , I don't know what else McGrath could have done to more perfectly capture the spirit and major plot elements of Miss Austen 's work , especially given the limitations of a two hour movie ( which some have complained about being too long ! ) . And as far as Gwen Paltrow 's accent is concerned , I must confess I wasn't too familiar with her when I saw this at the theater initially , and I was absolutely convinced at the time that she was an English actress ! I am taken aback by those who criticized the film for its lush scenery . That is one of the things I enjoy and look forward to seeing in period pieces set in the English countryside . The film 's beautiful backgrounds are a major contributor to its appeal and success . If your idea of escapist fare is something bleaker , then perhaps you should rent something like " Death Wish II ! " The English country settings are as attractive and charming as the cast , and combine with the story and soundtrack for entertainment that makes you not tire of repeat viewings . McGrath is a wonder at choreographing the interplay of subtle expressions that are so essential in conveying the complicated romantic intrigue that occurs in this story . This refreshing movie could also be a clinic on how enjoyable a film can be minus sex , violence or even a villainous antagonist . The story is often amusing , endearing , and at times , quite touching . I have seen many competent Jane Austen book adaptations but this is without question my favorite .  
  What a delightful film .. Accompanied by Oscar-winning Composer RACHEL PORTMAN 's lush , emotional and dreamy music , this film remains a pure delight worthy of viewing more than once a year . Incredible casting .. Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect for the role of Emma . Toni Collette was great as Harriett Smith . The character who stole the film was MISS BATES ! She was mesmerizing to watch , one finds oneself on the edge of ones ' seat just hanging on her every word and laughing hysterically WITH her . One of the most endearing characters I have come across in ages . From one of the opening scenes when she is thanking Mr . Woodhouse for sending " that lovely quarter-hind of pork .. PORK , MOTHER ! " she shouts into her daffy and clearly hearing impaired Mother , Mrs . Bates ( played by Emma Thompson 's mother , Phyllida Law ) who looks forlorn and lost . The comical ways that Emma would avoid the grating Miss Bates builds itself up for one truly gut-wrenching scene at the picnic when Emma insults Miss Bates who takes her cruel dig to her heart . We then see poor Miss Bates stammering and on the verge of tears and just so crushed one can not help but feel one 's heart ripped out to her on her behalf . It is a classic scene , one to be rewound and played over & over .. The ending is right up there with " Sense & Sensibility " and provides one of life 's greatest lessons about how one should marry one 's best friend .. I hope that this film delights you all as much as it has myself . I ADORED it !  
  Make the World go away . Get it off my shoulder . Say the things you used to say , and make the World go away . Well , Dave ( David Hewlett ) and Andrew ( Andrew Miller ) were in a pickle , one for embezzlement , and the other for kissing a child . Neither was guilty , but faced with charges and their house about to be torn down , they ended up in , well , nothing . The whole World , except for their house went away . It is kind of weird , but funny , too . Just what would you do if you were all alone in the world ? The two friends just enjoy each other 's company , and do what they want . But , that gets old fast , it seems . Then they start to improve their live by hating away memories . The sound effects during this were great . Things really got weird at the end . This film was the product of a great imagination , and written and directed by Vincenzo Natali , with help from the two stars . It just has to be seen .  
  I just saw this at the Toronto Film Festival , and I hope it gets wide release because I want to see it again ! It is a character-driven film , and Andrew and David are more than up to the task . Any discussion of the plot might be considered spoilers , so I 'll just say that the storyline is clever , the acting is superb , and the effects are amazing . Well-filmed and well-paced too . One of the best films I have seen in ages , and very refreshing in this summer of dreary movies . It had the audience laughing the whole time . See it if you can . ( I particularly liked the " Candy bar ! Candy bar ! " scene . )  
  all i have to say is if you don't like it then there is something wrong with you . plus Jessica is just all kinds of hot ! the only reason you may not like it is because it is set in the future where Seattle has gone to hell . that and you my not like it cause the future they show could very well happen .  
  The energetic young producer of theatrical prologues ( those staged performances , usually musical , that often proceeded the movie in the larger cinemas in bygone days ) must deal with crooked competition , fraudulent partners , unfaithful lovers & amateur talent to realize his dream of making his mark on the FOOTLIGHT PARADE . While closely resembling other Warner 's musical spectaculars , notably the GOLDDIGGER films , this movie had a special attraction none of the others had : Jimmy Cagney . He is a wonder , loose-jointed and lithe , as agile as any tomcat - a creature he actually mimics a few times during the movie . Cagney grabs the viewers attention & never lets go , powering the rapid-fire dialogue and corny plot with his charisma & buoyant charm . The rest of the cast gives their best , as well . Joan Blondell is perfect as the smart-mouthed , big-hearted blonde secretary , infatuated with Cagney ( major quibble - why wasn't she given a musical number ? ) . Dick Powell & Ruby Keeler once again play lovers onstage & off ; the fact that her singing & acting abilities are a bit on the lean side are compensated for by her dancing ; Powell still exudes boyish enthusiasm in his unaccustomed position as second male lead . Guy Kibbee & Hugh Herbert are lots of fun as brothers-in-law , both scheming to cheat Cagney in different ways . Ruth Donnelly scores as Kibbee 's wealthy wife , a woman devoted to her handsome protégés . Frank McHugh 's harried choreographer is an apt foil for Cagney 's wit . Herman Bing is hilarious in his one tiny scene as a music arranger . Mavens will spot little Billy Barty , Jimmy Conlin & maybe even John Garfield during the musical numbers . Finally , there 's Busby Berkeley , choreographer nonpareil . His terpsichorean confections , sprinkled throughout the decade of the 1930 's , were a supreme example of the cinematic escapism that Depression audiences wanted to enjoy . The big joke about Berkeley 's creations , of course , was that they were meant , as part of the plot , to be stage productions . But no theater could ever hold these products of the master 's imagination . They are perfect illustrations of the type of entertainment only made possible by the movie camera . Berkeley 's musical offerings generally took one of two different approaches , either a story ( often rather bizarre ) told with song & dance ; or else stunning geometrically designed numbers , eye candy , featuring plentiful chorus girls , overhead camerawork & a romantic tune . In a spasm of outré extravagance , FOOTLIGHT PARADE climaxes with three Berkeley masterworks : ` Honeymoon Hotel ' and its pre-Production Code telling of a couple 's wedding night ; ` By A Waterfall ' - dozens of unclad females , splashing , floating & diving in perfect patterns & designs ( peer closely & you 'll see how the synchronous effects were achieved ) ; and finally , ` Shanghai Lil ' - a fitting tribute to the talents of both Cagney & Berkeley .  
  Does anyone else cry tears of joy when they watch this film ? I LOVE it ! One of my Top 10 films of all time . It just makes me feel good . I watch the closing production number with all the cast members over and over and over ! Bebe Benson ( Michelle Johnston ) is THE babe of the film , IMHO ! I never saw the play but I get angry when I read reviews that say the play was better than the film . The two are like apples and oranges . The film making process will seldom deliver a finished product that is faithful to the original work . I believe it 's only due to the fear of public alienation that many well known works adapted to the screen aren't changed more than they are . This is a very good film , it is very satisfying . That 's all you need to know !  
  As a disclaimer , I 've seen the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years , and I only just saw the musical this week . This allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn't in the musical ( however , it tainted me when I watched the musical : ) ) I actually believe Michael Douglas worked quite well in that role , along with Kasey . I think her ' Let me dance for you scene ' is one of the best parts of the movie , a worthwhile addition compared to the musical . The dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical , as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger ( easier to do in the movie of course ) . The decors , lighting , dancing , and singing are also much superior in the movie , which should be expected , and was indeed delivered . The songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie , the new ones are quite good ones , and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion , especially compared to a musical which has few decors . The one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking , and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters , but their dancing is impeccable , and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical  
  I 've long wanted to see this film , being a fan of both Peter Cushing and David McCallum . I agree that the romantic sub-plot was a waste of time , but the talent of McCallum shines through this juvie role . Thank heavens for Turner Classic which aired the show last week . I can imagine that there were lots of problems with children after the war , especially with the way things were throughout the 1950s . Some of the boys are a bit scary . I certainly wouldn't want to met them on a well-lit street , much less a dark one . There were some good insights regarding the feelings of a firebug as well , or as they call him , a firefly .  
  As is nearly always the case , when Britain comes up with an entertaining and / or successful sit-com or quiz show , the Yanks will come along and poach the format and produce their own , grossly inferior , version . Man About The House is , of course , no exception to that rule . The Yanks ' version ( Three 's Company ) was unwatchable , braindead pap that seem to run forever . A prime example of quantity over ( non-existent ) quality . The original , on the other hand , is a fondly-remembered gem that had the savvy ( like Fawlty Towers ) to pull the plug at precisely the right time ( unlike the 637 episodes of ' hilarity ' that Three 's Company came up with ) . Jo was cute , there was brilliant chemistry between the Ropers , Richard O'Sullivan made it all look so easy , the scripts , whilst not exactly Oscar Wilde-standard , were consistently funny and Chrissy was THE most drop-dead gorgeous woman who has walked the face of this planet since The Dead Sea was merely feeling unwell . ' Nuff said .  
  The trailer for this movie didn't do the movie justice . And while the movie didn't know what it really wanted to get across , the first half of the movie being a light , romance comedy and the second have a more serious , romantic drama , the overall impact was much better than I thought it would be . This movie was more of a date movie , but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be . Kidman , being one of my favorites , of course I 'm biased , but this movie proved to be a light , sensitive , if somewhat quirky movie that deserved better . Three out of four stars . 9/5/02 .  
  An angry boy who has tragically lost his parents is looked after by his grandfather . Together they find common ground in the Gaelic folk tales which have been passed down orally from generation to generation of islanders . Although tragic episodes , such as the Highland clearances , feature in the stories , there is a surprising amount of humour and gaiety in them . It 's all filmed in Skye , so there is a double dose of beauty . The mountain scenery is breathtaking , and it 's a rare chance to hear Scottish Gaelic spoken . I 'm English , so I had to read the subtitles , but the sound of spoken Gaelic is nonetheless wonderful . The performances are just what you would expect from carefully chosen non-actors - in other words , you are watching the real thing - people who care deeply about Gaelic folklore and history . The Gaelic community , especially on Skye , worked innumerable minor miracles to make this film . Anyone who has the slightest interest in Gaelic , folk history , folk music , oral culture , Scotland , British history , multi-culturalism or social justice should go and see this film .  
  When I was little , my parents got this movie for me to watch . I really liked it , and I watched it over and over again . Even when I was in 3rd grade I still watched it from time to time . Recently , I watched it again , just for the sake of nostalgia , and though the show was not aimed for my age group ( I 'm in my late teens ) , I still found it entertaining and educational . This show teaches good lessons about imagination and getting along well with others . Some parts I found quite entertaining . Also , this show does not have any bad content , so you can leave kids alone with this show and not worry about them picking up any bad language or whatnot . I would recommend this .  
  I spotted this movie in the video store a few years ago and rented it . My husband and I enjoyed it so much we bought the VHS and have enjoyed it ever since . The plot has been well-discussed , so no need in going over it again . The point is this movie deserves repeated viewings . Americans , especially , aren't going to get all the jokes the first time around . I know I didn't . This movie is funny , touching , sad - all at the same time . When Ray proposes the toast at his daughter 's wedding , it 's cringe-inducing . When Karen calls Tony " Brian " as he attempts to kiss her , it 's heartbreaking . When Beano is finally cornered by the woman in black , it 's too funny for words . And the music : it 's as good as any movie soundtrack I 've heard in years . I was dancing in the living room to " All Over the World . " Every performance is absolutely perfect . Bill Nighy has been justly complimented for his portrayal of Ray , a man who has had one too many bad trips . Stephen Rea is perfect as Tony , the lovable keyboard player who has carried a torch for Karen all these years . He has an appealing hangdog look that makes women want to hug him . But all the actors are equally brilliant . Ignore any pans you read about this movie and see it . It 's a gem .  
  This is perhaps the best rockumentary ever - a British , better This Is Spinal Tap . The characters are believable , the plot is great , and you can genuinely empathise with some of the events - such as Ray 's problem with fitting in the band . The soundtrack is excellent . Real period stuff , even if it is in the same key , you 'll be humming some of the songs for days . What I liked was the nearly all-British cast , with some of the favourite household names . Ray 's wife is priceless .. The film never drags , it just goes at the right pace , and has some genuinely funny sections in it . A generator of some really good catchphrases ! It 's a hidden diamond .  
  Johny To makes here one of his best style exercises , making a strong film with a good Yakuza 's story . The election of the new Yakuza 's boss is the beginning of a war inside the organization . In my opinion the violence is wise used in the context , making a very strong gangs film . I specially love the way he tells the history , moving around all the roles inside the Yakuza 's family , and making that we see the violence , like the only way they have to solve their problems .. Talking about , the technical aspects , the film is a good example of paused , rythmic and planified way of shooting a film . One of the Hong Kong Films of the year . Is like Infernal affairs , but without the easy action-violence scenes , and the confused storyline . Strongly recommended to all Asian films lovers . ( sorry for my English , better do in Spanish lol )  
  It might be a little erroneous to open a review by describing a film in terms of other films , but I think it 's the best way to give an approximation of the place Election occupies in the gangster genre arena . It works somewhere in between The Godfather and Kinji Fukasaku 's yakuza opus The Yakuza Papers ( AKA Battles Without Honour and Humanity ) , in that it is simultaneously both romanticized and realistic , dark and gritty . But it 's also a Johnnie To film , and as such it carries the distinct touch of the Hong Kong auteur . Every two years the HK Triad elects a new boss . Only this time one of the candidates is not overly happy with the result so he decides to take matters into his own hands much to the dismay of the rest of the Triads and the police . That 's the story in a nutshell but rest assured it has a lot more going for it than that . As in The Yakuza Papers , there 's a great deal of scheming , back-stabbing and forming and switching of allegiances ( sometimes all it takes is a phone call - in one of the most memorable scenes I 've seen in recent time ) which might not necessarily make for deep drama but makes for an interesting plot and good character conflict . Fans of the gangster genre are likely to appreciate it in that aspect . Election is not as action-oriented as one might expect ; although it IS violent . And I 'm not talking about the glossy , glamour version of Hollywood violence . This is dark and grim . To 's camera lingers in the scenes of people being brutalized in ways that reveal both the humanity and inhumanity of the perpetrators and victims ; after all violence IS an integral part of us whether we like it or not . If you 're familiar with To 's style , then you should know what to expect . The pacing is relatively slow and deliberate . The cinematography is great , slick and dark in equal measures , utilizing dark hues ( brown , dark green and orange ) while the smooth tracking shots add a vibrant quality to it . In the end , Election occupies a peculiar place . It 's not exactly a character study and it 's not an action-oriented gangster film . It explores a situation ( the election and its aftermath ) , but does so in style , and is both realistic and romanticized ( the Triad ceremonies in particular echo of an oriental Godfather ) .  
  I saw this movie with a bunch of friends and although only two of us walked out of the cinema thinking how cool it was , the others just laughed and commented on how stupid it was . Well that was because it isn't supposed to be taken so seriously , basically it is a a movie that mocks horror flicks and does a damn good job .. There seems to be another movie coming out like that too , umm .. Scary Movie ? Well this is Aussie , and original ! Jessica Napier does a surperb performance and Sarah Kants has a definate bright future in acting ! I hope to see more of them . Molly Ringwald was a good move , and Kylie was an even better move . The Impossible Princess was Queen of the screen ! I recommend seeing this flick , as you 'll be guessing until the very end the connection with Raffy , Hilary and The movie that never got finished 20 years ago .  
  Personally , I enjoyed Cut thouroughly . It was the first time I 've seen a theatrically release Australian slasher flick . A genre normally restricted to the mainstream hollywood films . With all the usual cooky comedies and dramas coming out of Australia I loved being able to see a homegrown horror movie that wasn't a rip off of anything . I didn't even think it was really a spoof of other movies . It was a supernaturally theme horror like Nightmare on Elm Street , not Scream or I know What You Did Last Summer and therefore there was more of a suspension of disbelief . I think it 's about time Australian films tried to get more into the mainstream genres . Cut was original , scary enough and ultimately just a bit of fun . I 'd give it seven out of ten and wouldn't treat it as anything serious . It did what I expected it to do , entertain and scare me enough times to be satisfying . I enjoyed it .  
  for a slasher flick , this movie is actually better than a lot in the genre . yes it is predictable-resident nut job goes on killing spree , people die , yada yada yada . however there are some good positives in this film . first off , i really liked the mask the nut job wore . it is definitely creepy to say the least and possibly unique ( although i haven't watched every single slasher film ever made ) also , the genesis of the bad due is something i haven't seen before , and he way he finally meets his end is a novel concept , as far as i know . i also really liked the weapon of choice employed by Mr sicko , for most of the murders . the murders themselves are not as graphic as most in the genre , but that'a small concern . the movie does not take itself seriously , which is something most slashers suffer from . oddly enough , while watching the movie , i was reminded of the early " Friday the 13th films , which did take themselves seriously . there are a few concerns about this movie . in several scenes , the killer suddenly bears a strong resemblance to one of our horror icons . by this , i mean his movements and his reactions upon being shot , and also the way he walked . of bigger concern , however is a scene very close to the end , where Mr crazy bears a more than striking resemblance ( actually a complete rip off ) of another famous horror titan . and in the very last scenes , we have our scumbag , once again , looking exactly like the 1st horror icon i mentioned . in fact that last scene is almost a complete rip-off from another icon in the slasher genre . these scenes were weak and unoriginal ( obviously ) . by the way , the movie is set in Australia , so if you 're a sucker for a chick with an Aussie accent ( like me ) you 'll be in heaven . if you not , than it just might grate on you . one other great thing about this movie : beautiful Kylie Minogoue ( just don't get too attached to her ) there is one non Aussie accent , courtesy of Molly Ringwald . overall , there are more reasons to watch than not . i enjoyed it and had some fun . so , i have to give " Cut " 8/10 , which may seem too high to some people .  
  You can survive Surviving Christmas . I thought the television version was a bit edited way down . I like Ben Afleck . He plays Drew Johnson , a family-less adult , who is willing to pay complete strangers . The Valcos starring James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara as the parents and Christina Applegate as Lisa Valco , the daughter . Drew is lonely around the holidays because he doesn't have a family of his own so he rents out a family in the Chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars . Bill Macy who I best remember for playing Maude 's husband Arthur is hired to play Duda , the grandfather . When the whole situation comes crashing down , the truth can be painful . The Valcos household is crumbling apart from the Drew situation . Drew 's rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit . You can't buy what you wish for ! The acting and writing is mediocre but the first rate cast pulls it through to the final scene .  
  This was a must see documentary for me when I missed the opportunity in 2004 , so I was definitely going to watch the repeat . I really sympathised with the main character of the film , because , this is true , I have a milder condition of the skin problem he had , Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa ( EB ) . This is a sad , sometimes amusing and very emotional documentary about a boy with a terrible skin disorder . Jonny Kennedy speaks like a kid ( because of wasting vocal muscle ) and never went through puberty , but he is 36 years old . Most sympathising moments are seeing his terrible condition , and pealing off his bandages . Jonny had quite a naughty sense of humour , he even narrated from beyond the grave when showing his body in a coffin . He tells his story with the help of his mother , Edna Kennedy , his older brother and celebrity model , and Jonny 's supporter , Nell McAndrew . It won the BAFTAs for Best Editing and Best New Director ( Factual ) , and it was nominated for Best Sound ( Factual ) and the Flaherty Documentary Award . It was number 10 on The 100 Greatest TV Treats 2004 . A must see documentary !  
  Big S isn't playing with taboos or forcing an agenda like , say Mencia or Chapelle ( though I like them both ) . She states the obvious in subtle , near subliminal remarks . Her show won't change the World , nor is it meant to . But , along with the hilarious Brian Posehn and Paget Brewster 's ex-boyfriend Jay Johnston of " Mr . Show " fame , this is one mean show with an appetite for destruction ! My side 's were thoroughly wrecked by the first episode . Look , I love this woman and like her famed boyfriend , Jimmy Kimmel , she just delivers the lines and lets the viewer run - with-it . The best kind of comedy around . Spoofing anything and anyone , like " Mary Poppins " in the second episode when she sings to the fake birds on to quick hitting commentary on society and college aged existential nonsense . This one is highly recommended , but only for those who still have a funny bone ( and didn't lose it in their most recent lippo-suction treatment or boob job ) .  
  Sarah Silverman is a dangerous Bitch ! She 's beautiful , sexy , funny and talent , dark and demonic . I read the other ' comment ' on this show as well as the message board stuff and people just don't get it . Nothing that appears on T.V. is an accident . Too much money , time and work is put into the production of a T.V. show for there to be mistakes . This show is stupid because Sarah wanted it to be stupid . This show is juvenile because Sarah wanted it to be juvenile . I thought the jokes were great and the theme show as well as the other musical numbers are wonderfully bizarre . It 's a lot like Pee-Wee 's Playhouse for maladjusted , slacker twenty-something glue sniffing , Future Pornstars of America from the Valley . The cast is awesome . The scenarios and action is well-paced . I hope this show succeeds since Comedy Central didn't let David spade keep his show . Who plays Sarah 's sister ? She not in the cast listing on the show 's home page . I would love to see her stand-up . Does anyone know about her up-coming show dates or DVDs that may be floating around out there ?  
  Sarah Silverman is like a totally manic Zooey Deschanel and I think I 'm in love already . Yeah , if you loved Jesus is Magic , you 'll love this . If you didn't , what the heck is wrong with you ? Kudos to the Comedy Channel for shoving this in my face . My life finally has meaning , and " Your car smells like farts " is my kind of humor . I 'm a happy guy . The first episode had me laughing hysterically and I 'm hungrily looking forward to next week . This is like Grease meets South Park . Completely outrageous . Sarah Silverman is someone I could watch reading the phone book . Her delivery is precise and oh so funny . She never skips a beat . Come to think of it , it 's not so much her choice of material . which is some really good stuff by the way , as it is the way she chooses to deliver it . Thank you , Sarah Silverman ! Thank you , Comedy Channel !  
  One question that must be asked immediately is : Would this film have been made if the women in it were not the aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis ? The answer is : Probably not . But , thankfully , they are ( or were ) the cousin and aunt of Jackie . This documentary by the Maysles brothers on the existence ( one could hardly call it a life ) of Edith B . Beale , Jr . , and her daughter Edith Bouvier Beale ( Edie ) , has the same appeal of a train wreck - you don't want to look but you have to . Big Edith and Little Edie live in a once magnificent mansion in East Hampton , New York , that is slowly decaying around them . The once beautiful gardens are now a jungle . Magnificent oil painting lean against the wall ( with cat feces on the floor behind them ) and beautiful portraits of them as young women vie for space on the walls next to covers of old magazines . Living alone together for many years has broken down many barriers between the two women but erected others . Clothing is seems to be optional . Edie 's favorite costume is a pair of shorts with panty hose pulled up over them and bits and pieces of cloth wrapped and pinned around her torso and head . As Edith says " Edie is still beautiful at 56 . " And indeed she is . There are times when she is almost luminescent and both women show the beauty that once was there . There is a constant undercurrent of sexual tension . Their eating habits are ( to be polite ) strange . Ice cream spread on crackers . A dinner party for Edith 's birthday of Wonder Bread sandwiches served on fine china with plastic utensils . Time is irrelevant in their world ; as Edie says " I don't have any clocks . " Their relationships with men are oh-so-strange . Edie feels like Edith thwarted any of her attempts at happiness . She says " If you can't get a man to propose to you , you might as well be dead . " To which Edith replies " I 'll take a dog any day . " It is obvious that Edith doesn't see her role in Edie 's lack of male companionship . Early in the film she states " France fell but Edie didn't . Sometimes it is difficult to hear exactly what is being said . Both women talk at the same time and constantly contradict each other . There is a strange relationship with animals throughout the film ; Edie feeds the raccoons in the attic with Wonder Bread and cat food . The cats ( and there are many of them ) are everywhere . At one point Edie declares " The hallmark of aristocracy is responsibility . " But they seem to be unable to take responsibility for themselves . This is a difficult film to watch but well worth the effort .  
  Trawling through the Sci Fi weeklies section of the local Video Rentals store I was losing hope of finding any good movies I hadn't yet seen . Renting Cypher was like a punt on a possibly very lame horse . My son is so jaded with current " B " Science Fiction that he hasn't bothered seeing this yet . It must be noted I didn't see anything about Cypher when it was released in Australia . It must have been very quiet or I just missed it . Well this WAS a really pleasant surprise ! This is also no B movie . It 's not a " blockbuster " of the epic variety and doesn't try to be - more a quiet movie that needs to be seen several times for it 's plot to be fully savoured . The special effects are powerfully presented when they are used - my only complaint is the super helo is a leetle obviously CGI at first view , but they get it right at it 's 2nd appearance , & that aside everything else is top notch . In any case the affects are secondary . I won't give anything away about the plot . The plot structure has a Russian Doll aspect a little reminiscent of Basic Instinct ( though with very different content ) . Just I will say that Choosing Jeremy Northam for the lead was a master stroke . The actor was born in Cambridge ENGLAND , and his accent for this film hits the ear as a sort of extremely forced New England dialect , it 's a tad off key . See the final twist of the plot and you 'll see why that is such a brilliant choice ! And Lucy Liu is also just right with her " will she kiss me - will she shoot me " edge . I rarely watch movies several times within days - this is one of them .  
  After the success of Die Hard and it 's sequels it 's no surprise really that in the 1990s , a glut of ' Die Hard on a .. ' movies cashed in on the wrong guy , wrong place , wrong time concept . That is what they did with Cliffhanger , Die Hard on a mountain just in time to rescue Sly ' Stop or My Mom Will Shoot ' Stallone 's career . Cliffhanger is one big nit-pickers dream , especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing , base-jumping , aviation , facial expressions , acting skills . All in all it 's full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk . Stallone even managed to get out-acted by a horse ! However , if you an forget all the nonsense , it 's actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills , and unintentionally , plenty of laughs . You 've got to love John Lithgows sneery evilness , his tick every box band of baddies , and best of all , the permanently harassed and hapless ' turncoat ' agent , Rex Linn as Travers . He may of been Henry in ' Portrait of a Serial Killer ' but Michael Rooker is noteworthy for a cringe-worthy performance as Hal , he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captors ' that man never hurt anybody ' And whilst he surely can't be , it really does look like Ralph Waite 's Frank character is grinning as the girl plummets to her death . Mention too must go to former ' London 's Burning ' actor Craig Fairbrass as the Brit bad guy , who comes a cropper whilst using Hal as a Human Football , yes , you can't help enjoy that bit , Hal needed a good kicking . So forget your better judgement , who cares if ' that could never happen ' , lower your acting expectations , turn up the volume and enjoy ! And if you 're looking for Qaulen , he 's the one wearing the helicopter .  
  I don't think I 'll ever understand the hate for Renny Harlin . ' Die Hard 2 ' was cool , and he gave the world ' Cliffhanger ' , one of the most awesome action movies ever . That 's right , you little punks , ' Cliffhanger ' rules , and we all know it . Sly plays Gabe Walker , a former rescue climber who is ' just visiting ' his old town when he is asked to help a former friend , Hal Tucker ( Michael Rooker ) , assist in a rescue on a mountain peak . Walker obviously came back at a convenient time , because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by Eric Qualen ( John Lithgow ) . Qualen & co . have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the U.S. government somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and they really would like it back .. Essentially , ' Cliffhanger ' is another ' Die Hard ' clone . Just trade in the confines of Nakatomi Plaza to the open mountain ranges of the Rocky Mountains , complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him mortal . Naturally , that set up is totally ripped to shreds soon enough , as Stallone 's character avoids quite a large number of bullets with ease , and slams face-first into several rock faces with no apparent side-effects . After all , isn't that what action movies are all about ? ' Cliffhanger ' is one of the most exciting action movies around . A showcase of great scenes and stunts . One of the early stunts is one of the best stunts I 've ever seen in a movie , and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning , it maintains its action awesomeness . John Lithgow 's lead villain is entertaining , and one bad dude . Quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever . ' Cliffhanger ' is easily one of Stallone 's best efforts , definitely Renny Harlin 's best effort , and a very exciting action movie - 9/10  
  Good horror movies from France are quite rare , and it 's fairly easy to see why ! Whenever a talented young filmmaker releases a staggering new film , he emigrates towards glorious Hollywood immediately after to directed the big-budgeted remake of another great film classic ! How can France possibly build up a solid horror reputation when their prodigy-directors leave the country after just one film ? " Haute Tension " was a fantastic movie and it earned director Alexandre Aja a ( one-way ? ) ticket to the States to remake " The Hills Have Eyes " ( which he did terrifically , I may add ) . Eric Valette 's long-feature debut " Maléfique " was a very promising and engaging horror picture too , and he 's already off to the Hollywood as well to direct the remake of Takashi Miike 's ghost-story hit " One Missed Call " . So there you have it , two very gifted Frenchmen that aren't likely to make any more film in their native country some time soon . " Maléfique " is a simple but efficient chiller that requires some patience due to its slow start , but once the plot properly develops , it offers great atmospheric tension and a handful of marvelous special effects . The film almost entirely takes place in one single location and only introduces four characters . We 're inside a ramshackle French prison cell with four occupants . The new arrival is a businessman sentenced to do time for fraud , the elderly and " wise " inmate sadistically killed his wife and then there 's a crazy transvestite and a mentally handicapped boy to complete the odd foursome . They find an ancient journal inside the wall of their cell , belonging to a sick murderer in the 1920 's who specialized in black magic rites and supernatural ways to escape . The four inmates begin to prepare their own escaping plan using the bizarre formulas of the book , only to realize the occult is something you shouldn't mess with Eric Valette dedicates oceans of time to the character drawings of the four protagonists , which occasionally results in redundant and tedious sub plots , but his reasons for this all become clear in the gruesome climax when the book suddenly turns out to be some type of Wishmaster-device . " Maléfique " is a dark film , with truckloads of claustrophobic tension and several twisted details about human behavior . Watch it before some wealthy American production company decides to remake it with four handsome teenage actors in the unconvincing roles of hardcore criminals .  
  Maléfique is a very interesting movie . It is an unholy alloy of triumphs and failures . The central concept is great , three inmates with bizarre personalities are joined by a fourth ( who the audience identify with ) and they try to escape from their cell using a book of magic that they find within the walls of the cell . The atmosphere is well-woven , it reminds me of reading about the prison stay of Edmond Dantes ' in the Château d'If ( prior to becoming the Count of Monte Cristo ) . The director sets up the feeling that the characters are tied to the cell , particularly the character we are meant to identify with ( Carrère - a white-collar criminal whose crime is not specified , but it 's obliquely suggested might be fraud ) . On one occasion Carrère dithers when leaving the cell for exercise and has the cell door shut on him ; we never leave the cell , the claustrophobia is unbroken . There are also no shots of the prison outside the cell , and the view through the bars is a longing sunset over a generic prison wall . So even though the film appears to be very modern , it has a very old world feel of incarceration . The characters are intriguing . We have Marcus , a violent pre-op transsexual who plays an abusive mother to Pâquerette ( French for Daisy ) a heavily retarded young man . Pâquerette likes to eat everything he finds beautiful , and unfortunately this included his baby sister , hence his current predicament ( I like this comment on internalisation , very primitive ) . Lasalle is a withdrawn , possessed elderly man , in for brutally murdering his wife . The central message of the movie is that your desires will annihilate you , and there 's a ritual that goes with that . I think that 's what disturbs me the most , seeing people destroying themselves ritualistically . It has a real life ring to it . The quite simple soundtrack backs this up well , every step deeper into the quicksand is accompanied by the dull ringing of a gong . I 'm actually hearing the gong now every time I do something self-destructive . I think one of the plot problems is that the ends of the characters don't really reinforce the message consistently , particularly with Carrère , also the concept of the book seems to alter throughout the film , not in terms of a successive revelation either . I also think that some of the images we see are a bit amateurish , more by design than execution , such as the famous " vagina eye " , and the sodomy of Lasalle , for me , totally hollow images . At the end the movie it feels like the director is in a rush to get it over with , and some things don't seem logical , for example we 've been clumsily led to believe different things about Carrère 's child . This doesn't change the fact though that what we have here is that rare bird , a " pure " horror movie . There is no comedic dross or genre segueing , like Cube ( 1997 / Natali ) , the obvious movie to compare it to , it 's a total immersion experience , where you feel as if you are in the cell with the characters . This last comment I make about it being a " pure " experience I think is something others have mentioned as well so that is a fairly unanimous point . On a personal note my favourite part of the film is when Lasalle talks about his past as a librarian . He very vividly describes a scene where he goes to work one day and sits down in his usual place in the centre of a room where all the books are arranged in a circle around him . The books seem to be chanting to him that he will never contain their knowledge . This prompts Lasalle to go insane . That really is the problem with an obsession with understanding and knowledge . It 's something I myself have felt . One final comment is that two of the quite well-received comments on the board have confused the characters ' names . To convince yourself that Lasalle is the older librarian character , simply click on Philippe Laudenbach 's page and you will see he was born in 1936 .  
  This movie is wonderful . The writing , directing , acting all are fantastic . Very witty and clever script . Quality performances by actors , Ally Sheedy is strong and dynamic and delightfully quirky . Really original and heart-warmingly unpredicatable . The scenes are alive with fresh energy and really talented production .  
  Neither the total disaster the UK critics claimed nor the misunderstood masterpiece its few fanboys insist , Revolver is at the very least an admirable attempt by Guy Ritchie to add a little substance to his conman capers . But then , nothing is more despised than an ambitious film that bites off more than it can chew , especially one using the gangster / con-artist movie framework . As might be expected from Luc Besson 's name on the credits as producer , there 's a definite element of ' Cinema de look ' about it : set in a kind of realistic fantasy world where America and Britain overlap , it looks great , has a couple of superbly edited and conceived action sequences and oozes style , all of which mark it up as a disposable entertainment . But Ritchie clearly wants to do more than simply rehash his own movies for a fast buck , and he 's spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life , the universe and everything . If anything its problem is that he 's trying to throw in too many influences ( a bit of Machiavelli , a dash of Godard , a lot of the Principles of Chess ) , motifs and techniques , littering the screen with quotes : the film was originally intended to end with three minutes of epigrams over photos of corpses of mob victims , and at times it feels as if he never read a fortune cookie he didn't want to turn into a movie . Rather than a commercial for Kabbalism , it 's really more a mixture of the overlapping principles of commerce , chess and confidence trickery that for the most part pulls off the difficult trick of making the theosophy accessible while hiding the film 's central ( somewhat metaphysical ) con . The last third is where most of the problems can be found as Jason Statham takes on the enemy ( literally ) within with lots of ambitious but not always entirely successful crosscutting within the frame to contrast people 's exterior bravado with their inner fear and anger , but it 's got a lot going for it all the same . Not worth starting a new religion over , but I 'm surprised it didn't get a US distributor . Maybe they found Ray Liotta 's intentionally fake tan just too damn scary ?  
  " The Godfather " of television , but aside from it 's acclaim and mobster characters , the two are nothing alike . Tony Soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks . His psychiatrist learns that Tony is actually part of two families - in one family he is a loving father yet not so perfect husband , and in the other family he is a ruthless wiseguy . After analysis , Dr . Melfi concludes that Tony 's problems actually derive from his mother Livia , who 's suspected to have borderline-personality disorder . Gandolfini is rightfully praised as the main character ; yet Bracco and Marchand aren't nearly as recognized for their equally and talented performances as the psychiatrist and mother , respectively . Falco , Imperioli and DeMatteo are acclaimed for their brilliant supporting roles . Van Zandt ( from the E-Street Band ) plays his first and only role as Tony 's best friend , and is quite convincing and latching . Chianese , the only recurring actor to have actually appeared in a Godfather film , plays Tony 's uncle and on-and-off nemesis . Many fans also enjoyed characters played by Pastore , Ventimiglia , Curatola , Proval , Pantoliano , Lip , Sciorra and Buscemi . Tony 's children are " okay " but not notable ( with the exception of Iler 's stunning performance in the third-to-last episode , " The Second Coming " ) ; Sirico and Schirripa are unconvincing and over-the-top , but the show is too strong for them to hold it back . Even as the show continues for over six season , it ceases to have a dull or predictable moment . * ( out of four )  
  I think you would have to be from the USA to get a lot of the jokes . But if you liked Princess Bride and Forest Gump , You would like this movie . You can't compare the quality of the filming to those of course , but having the cameraman trip was obviously done on purpose . Killer Tomatoes is a hundred times better than Nepolean Dynamite . Just my opinion . I 'm sure that people from France would not appreciate the caricatures of the French . So this film isn't for a world audience . And while I am not a trained film critic , I know what I like . I couldn't stop laughing through the whole movie . My sides and my jaws were hurting at the end of the movie .  
  George Raft as Steve Brodie , the carefree , dancing gambler who can never refuse a dare , is pitted against the lumbering , sentimental , Chuck Connors ( Wallace Beery ) . A soft touch for every panhandler , Connors impulsively adopts waifs and strays , notably runaway orphan " Swipes " ( Jackie Cooper , complete with kittens ! ) and the homeless Lucy Calhoun , an out-of-town innocent with ambitions to become a writer . In this male-dominated culture , communication takes place mostly in the form of violence ( one sees why THE BOWERY is a Martin Scorsese favorite ) . Exploding cigars provide a running gag . " Swipes " enjoys throwing rocks through windows in Chinatown , on one occasion setting a laundry alight . ( The simultaneous arrival of both Brodie 's and Beery 's volunteer fire companies leads to a brawl , during which the building burns to the ground . ) Beery casually saps a troublesome girl , and thumps anyone who disagrees with him , including Brodie , whom he defeats , in a night-time fist fight on a moored barge , to regain control of his saloon , lost on a bet that Brodie wouldn't have the courage to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge . ( Brodie does make the leap , but only because a subterfuge with a dummy fails at the last moment . ) As usual , Walsh fills the frame with detail , illustrating with relish the daily life of the tenderloin ; singing waiters , bullying barmen , whores from Suicide Hall being hustled into the Black Maria , tailors collaring hapless hicks off the street and forcing them to buy suits they don't want . A minor but admirable little film .  
  The symbolic use of objects , form editing , the position of characters in the scene .. these were all used with such joyous abandon by Hitchcock that you can really see what a fertile genius he had . The way the wife moves from one corner of the ring to the other as the fight progresses , the editing when the wedding ring is placed on her finger .. while these may seem a bit obvious by todays standards , in the silent era they spoke volumes about the story without a word being spoken . Even the title has a least four meanings that I can see ; the boxing ring , the wedding ring , the bracelet the lover buys , and the love triangle at the heart of the story .  
  I first watched the Walking Tall movies when I was about 8 years old and I thought both Joe Don Baker and Bo Svenson did a great job , they must have anyway because since watching the movies , I have tried to learn as much about the real Sheriff Buford Pusser as I can . All 3 parts of the movie gave me chills and Buford Pusser was a true hero , I only wish he were alive today and that there were more people like him . I would love to thank him for getting rid of all the crime and being so brave . I am very sorry that his family had to go through such horror and pain . My heart goes out to them . So from a 30 year old fan of Sheriff Pusser and of the 3-part Walking Tall movies and the actors that portrayed him , please do not be negative about these movies and actors , they were only trying to let us know what a wonderful man the real Buford Pusser was and what a great family he had . And to all the young people who may have not heard much about Buford , I suggest you watch the Walking Tall movies and learn more about him .  
  Ever wanted to know just how much Hollywood could get away with before the Hayes Code was officially put into effect ? Well , unfortunately " Convention City " is lost , so well just have to watch " Tarzan and His Mate " to find out . For 1934 , there is a remarkable amount of sexual innuendo and even exposed flesh . Just look at Jane 's nude swim . While Tarzan is often thought of as b-adventure films made for young boys and no one else , this picture proves that the series was originally very adult . Over seventy years later , it is still as sexy as it was when it came out . In addition to the envelope pushing taboo nature , it is a superb and exciting adventure story . I 've always enjoyed the jungle films that Hollywood churned out in the 30s and the 40s , but there are few from the genre I 'd call great films . " Tarzan and His Mate " is by far the best film from this long gone subgenre . The sequences of the attacks on the safari by either apes or natives still manage to create tension today . Also , the animals are all too cool ( espescially the apes throwing boulders ) . The acting won't win any major awards soon , but is certainly more than adequate for this type of picture . The film is once again stolen by Cheetah , the smartest monkey in the jungle . One of the most entertaining examples of pre-code Hollywood out there .  
  The first of the Tarzan movies staring Johnny Weissmuller . The plot has already been summarized so i wont go into it again . Just know that The actors who play Jane and Tarzan were born for the role . If you have not seen this film and you only have the modern day Tarzan films as a reference .. you are missing a Real treat . Doesn't matter how far we 've come in movie making , makeup set designs .. no one will ever play Tarzan as well as Johnny Weissmuller did . He was and is Tarzan .  
  " Tarzan and His Mate " , the second of MGM 's Tarzan pictures , picks up a year after the events of " Tarzan the Ape Man " . Tarzan and Jane have been living happily in the jungle , and Harry Holt ( one of the expeditioners in the first film ) returns , this time accompanied by the less-than-honorable Martin Arlington , in quest of the ivory from the elephants ' graveyard . Naturally , a variety of perilous and exciting adventures take place along the way . The first film romanticized everything-the jungle , adventure , romance itself , wild animals , and even death . The second film still has a great deal of romanticism and a lot of wonderful action sequences , but a more serious tone underlies the action . The characters dare to ask questions like : What if something happened to Tarzan ? What would Jane do if she was stranded by herself in the middle of the jungle and she had to fend for herself ? While these are probably the questions real people would be asking in this situation , it creates a certain amount of somberness that isn't always as much fun as the throw caution to the wind attitude of the original . One of the most enjoyable aspects of this film is the growth we see in Tarzan and Jane 's relationship . Tarzan still speaks very broken English , but he has clearly learned a few new words from his mate . Additionally , their love for each other has really blossomed , and we feel like they really have spent a year together in the jungle . Most people consider " Tarzan and His Mate " superior to the original " Tarzan the Ape Man " . Personally , I liked the first film just a little bit better . The main reason is that the relationship between the Harry Holt & Martin Arlington team isn't nearly as likable as Holt 's relationship with James Parker ( Jane 's father ) from the original . The Mr . Arlington character could have worked as a great movie villain , but he plays the hero for far too much of the movie . The movie can never decide whether we should like him or hate him . ( Also , I don't want to give anything away , but in one of the scenes where we should clearly hate him , Jane never finds out about those events , so the ending isn't quite as satisfying as it could have been . ) All of these detractors are relatively minor , however , and it 's still a great movie . Like the first film , " Tarzan and His Mate " has amazing action scenes , wonderful wildlife footage , and one of the screen 's all-time greatest romances . If you liked the first film in the series , this is definitely a sequel to see .  
  There 's something wonderful about the fact that a movie made in 1934 can be head and shoulders above every Tarzan movie that followed it , including the bloated and boring 1980s piece Greystoke . Once the viewer gets past the first three scenes , which are admittedly dull , Tarzan and his Mate takes off like a shot , offering non-stop action , humor , and romance . Maureen O'Sullivan is charming and beautiful as Jane and walks off with the movie . Weismuller is solid as well . Highly recommended .  
  To get in touch with the beauty of this film pay close attention to the sound track , not only the music , but the way all sounds help to weave the imagery . How beautifully the opening scene leading to the expulsion of Gino establishes the theme of moral ambiguity ! Note the way music introduces the characters as we are led inside Giovanna 's marriage . Don't expect to find much here of the political life of Italy in 1943 . That 's not what this is about . On the other hand , if you are susceptible to the music of images and sounds , you will be led into a word that reaches beyond neo-realism . By the end of the film we there are moments Antonioni-like landscape that has more to do with the inner life of the characters than with real places . This is one of my favorite Visconti films .  
  TCM is keeping me awake all the time .. they keep coming up with films Ive never heard of .. Senso .. now Ossessione .. a very early film by Visconti ! .. wow .. the Italian version of The Postman Always Rings Twice .. brilliant ! beautifully acted and directed .. Never heard of either leads who were excellent , Clara Calamai , as Giovanna , and especially , Massimo Girotti as Gino .. what a sensual man ! more muscular and attractive than anyone else on the screen in 1943 ! His look was ahead of its time .. many male stars from the 1950s were probably inspired by him .. he should have been a major world wide star ! The film is much better than the Jack Nicholson / Jessica Lange version and less glossier than the MGM version ( which I really like ) with John Garfield and Lana Turner remember that white outfit ? who can forget .. This Italian version is different .. more realistic and with a very different ending .. see it watch it .. Im going to buy it !  
  A masterful treatment of James Caine 's " The Postman Always Rings Twice " as Luchino Visconti 's first film shot primarily around Ferrara in a soulless war-torn Italy . The original negative was thought destroyed but Visconti saved a print and fortunately we can see this early neo-realist work today . A ruggedly handsome Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai ( who had recently revealed her breasts in La Cena delle beffe " ( 1941 ) , star as the sensually-charged and ill-fated lovers who plot to kill her husband . Unusual ending in which , although crime does not pay , one pays in a way not directly linked to the crime . Excellent direction , script , acting , and cinematography . Reportedly not as good as the French " Le Dernier tournant ' ( 1939 ) but probably better than the US version ( 1946 ) featuring Lana Turner and John Garfield in the lead roles . Highly recommended .  
  Ossessione , adapted loosely ( or if it is as loose or close to the version I saw of James M . Cain 's The Postman Always Rings Twice with Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange I can't be certain ) by first time director Luchino Visconti , is no less outstanding with usage of mis-en-scene , music ( both diegetic and non-diegetic ) , and the acting . I didn't know what to expect Visconti to do in his approach to the material , after seeing La Terra Trema and seeing how sometimes his political motivations snuck in a little bit . But this is a totally character and emotional based drama , bordering on melodrama ( however , without the conventions that bog down lesser ones ) , and with the style in the finest path of the budding film-noir movement , Visconti creates a debut that 's as involving as any other neo-realist film . Neo-realism , by the way , could rightfully be claimed as this being a forefather ( along with De Sica 's The Children Are Watching Us ) , which that would take shape after the war . Although love and romance is more in play here than in some of the more famous neo-realist efforts , it 's dealt with in a bare-bones storytelling fashion , and it 's laced with other familiar themes in neo-realism ( the lower-class , death , desperation ) . Aside from the story , which is simply as it is described on this site , the artistry with which Visconti captures the images , and then layers them with objects ( a shawl over Gino Costa 's profile when in guilt ) , shadows and darkness that tend to overcome many of the later scenes in the film ( usually over Gian and Giovanna ) , and the feel of the Italian streets in many of the exterior scenes . Domenico Scala and Aldo Tonti ( who would lens some of Rossellini and Fellini 's films ) help in envisioning the look of Ossessione , which is usually moving in on a character , then pausing to read as much emotion on their faces , their voices and mannerisms lovely and ugly , sad and dark and romantic . I think I 've just scratched the surface on how effective it was that the film itself was moving me along , even as I was in fear of the futures of the two leads . The two leads ( Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai ) portray all the compelling , truthful , and near-operatic emotions , and the key supporting actors are also without their attributes . It 's a brilliant , crushing adaptation , and it points as a striking signpost of what was to come for Visconti in his career .  
  Citizen X tells the story of Andrei Chikatilo , The Ripper of Rostov , who killed 52 people in 8 years time , mainly women and children . It shows how the investigation was obstructed by Soviet bureaucracy , how hard it was to investigate the crimes . It does the job in such a brilliant way that it will leave no-one untouched . In the beginning it 's perhaps a little bit slow of pace , but it really grabs you as the story unfolds . I can only say that , next to " The Silence of the Lambs " , this is by far the best movie about a serial killer I 've ever seen . It is very hard to say which actor 's performance stands out above the rest in this movie . Stephen Rea is really brilliant as the inexperienced forensic expert who is put in charge of the investigation . Donald Sutherland 's performance as his cynical superior , and the only person in the Russian government willing to help him , is as outstanding as Rea 's . And what to say about Jeffrey DuMann , playing the serial killer ? DuMann brilliantly created a character who inspires empathy rather than hatred . Yes , he is a monster , but he is also a sad figure , oppressed and ridiculed by his wife , his boss , his co-workers .. He is tortured , ashamed , as well as extremely vicious . I can only recommend this movie to everybody who 's interested in a well-made docu-drama , where the actors are still more important than the special effects . It deserves at least a 9/10 , perhaps even more if you ask me .  
  This is your typical cheerful and colorful MGM musical from the early ' 50 's and it 's definitely on of the better ones to watch out there . The movie got directed by the genre expert Vincente Minnelli and stars Gene Kelly in the main lead . Both did quite a few movies together back in those days , of which this one is probably their best known one . The movie itself actually managed to win the best picture Oscar over the year , which meant it beat out movies such as " A Place in the Sun " , " A Streetcar Named Desire " , " The African Queen " , " Quo Vadis " , " The Blue Veil " , " Death of a Salesman " that year . A real accomplishment of course but at the same time also a bit too much credit for this delightful , bright and entertaining movie . When you watch this movie you surely will be entertained by it all , which is also thanks to the movie its beautiful color look and the many nice characters within this movie . The musical numbers are also all nicely done , which is no big surprise when you have people such as Vincente Minnelli and Gene Kelly at work . But really , couldn't had everything that got told in this movie been done in halve an hour less or so ? I mean , we already know where the movie is heading to but yet it manages to stretch it out all for as long as possible . Not that it makes the movie drag in any parts , it just makes it a bit overlong . The movie could had also definitely been done with a few less musical numbers in it . One of the better MGM musicals , that is not without its flaws though . 8/10  
  Timeless musical gem , with Gene Kelly in top form , stylish direction by Vincente Minnelli , and wonderful musical numbers . It is great entertainment from start to finish , one of those films that people watch with a smile and say " they don't make ' em like they used to ! " But they never did quite make them like this . The climactic 25 minute musical sequence without any dialogue is among the most beautiful in film history . Movie magic , clearly derived from the heart and soul of everyone involved . A must see !  
  Way back in 1955 , the British made a comedy called Simon and Laura , with Peter Finch and the brilliant Kay Kendall . To this day , it stands as one of the finest examples of British comedy and , more particularly , about how television sitcoms become so popular . It was , and is , an excellent example also of self-referential cinema . So also Soapdish , a film I 'd never heard about until a few nights ago when I caught it on late TV . I was a bit dubious at first simply because comedy is so difficult to do well , as you know . However , I was pleasantly surprised and delighted to watch a very clever satire about daytime American TV . In fact , it 's been a while since I laughed so heartily . So , if you like satire , I 'd recommend you see it . The main actors  Sally Field , Kevin Kline , Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty  quite simply do an excellent job , revealing just how bitchy and shallow the business of acting is . As I watched it , I kept thinking to myself : just how much of this bitchiness carries over into real life ? That is , if actors ever do have a real life ? As you probably know , Peter Sellers , for example , was notorious for hiding his true persona behind a multitude of characters , so that nobody really knew the real person . So , as I watched Sally Field playing Celeste Talbot playing Maggie , I thought again about that earlier British film with Kay Kendall playing Laura playing a character in a TV sitcom opposite Peter Finch .. Is it any wonder that some actors have nervous breakdowns ? And that feeling was crystallized when Celeste finally confronts her daughter ( Lori , played by Elizabeth Shue ) and , in an emotional moment , repeats the fictional lines she 'd used , on a prior episode of her daytime soap , when confronting her fictional daughter in that show ! Are you confused ? Well , it 's not all like that , but the dialog is stunning for originality , comedy , bitchiness , anger , depravity , duplicity , and even .. love . The story ? Well , there are many stories in this film , all interwoven , and which all come together at the end ( of course  but not like a Robert Altman film , okay ! ) , and not all of them are resolved finally . Life 's not like that anyway , right ? The pace is almost frenetic , and you really do have to watch and listen carefully to catch all the sight gags and subtle jokes . Spend the 97 minutes from your life and watch it ; you won't regret the time usage . The rest of the cast all perform well , although I 've never taken much to Whoopi Goldberg . Perhaps the funniest exchanges are between Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty and , for my money , the latter steals so many scenes from others , she gets my vote as the outstanding player . I kid you not , she gives the term bitch an entirely new face ..  
  Greetings again from the darkness . Insight into the mind and motivation of a wonderful artist . How strange for most of us to see someone who MUST work .. no matter the conditions , else his reason for living ceases . To see Goldsworthy 's sculptures come alive and to see his reaction to each is extremely voyeuristic . This artist creates because he must - not for money or fame . It is his lifeforce . When you see his failures , energy seems to expel from his body like a burst hot air balloon . It is not the dread of beginning again , it is that he takes his energy from his work . Watching him create just to have nature takeover and recall his work is somewhat painful , but nonetheless , breathtaking . He discusses flow and time in the minimal dialog and there appears to be little doubt that the artist and the earth are one in the same . When he says he needs the earth , but it does not need him .. I beg to differ . Only complaint is the musical score seems to slow down further a pace that is relaxing at best .

  Zero Day is a film few people have gotten to see , and what a shame that is . When I saw the end , where the two main characters descend upon the room and mercilessly kill people , then commit suicide , and it made me grab my stomach . I was shaking , that 's how strong this movie is . The movie is amazing . It 's too incredible not to get a perfect ten . It 's sad that so few people understand the true beauty of this film . It is not a budget which makes a film good , it is the amount of feeling the makers put into it which makes it good . It leaves a permanent impression in your mind that you simply cannot get out . It makes you realise the true horror of shootings - especially if you were to know that person , and this movie makes you feel like you know these people . I recommend Zero Hour to those who feel they are mature enough to watch it . I am fourteen , and I feel that this film is just too amazing to be put into words . It feels like you 're watching something that actually happened .  
  Since was only a toddler when this show originally aired I just recently picked up the DVD set and am wishing there were more episodes filmed . This show was a 70s version of the poplular 90 's TV series " X-Files " - but with a bit more of a comedic / light hearted approach . But don't get me wrong , some of these episodes have full on horror themes , many in which have some pretty greuesome plots ( left to the imagination of course - this was the early 70s television ) . Some of the plots where a bit silly as well as the acting , but that is the charm and attraction to this series . Whether you like mystery crime dramas , comedies , or sci-fi / horror themes , this series brought all that together . Each episode clocked in at around 50 minutes or so ( 1 hour with commercials ) and that 50 minutes goes by quick always leaving me wanting more . A great classic show that is underrated in my book !  
  I remember the original series vividly mostly due to it 's unique blend of wry humor and macabre subject matter . Kolchak was hard-bitten newsman from the Ben Hecht school of big-city reporting , and his gritty determination and wise-ass demeanor made even the most mundane episode eminently watchable . My personal fave was " The Spanish Moss Murders " due to it 's totally original storyline . A poor , troubled Cajun youth from Louisiana bayou country , takes part in a sleep research experiment , for the purpose of dream analysis . Something goes inexplicably wrong , and he literally dreams to life a swamp creature inhabiting the dark folk tales of his youth . This malevolent manifestation seeks out all persons who have wronged the dreamer in his conscious state , and brutally suffocates them to death . Kolchak investigates and uncovers this horrible truth , much to the chagrin of police captain Joe " Mad Dog " Siska ( wonderfully essayed by a grumpy Keenan Wynn ) and the head sleep researcher played by Second City improv founder , Severn Darden , to droll , understated perfection . The wickedly funny , harrowing finale takes place in the Chicago sewer system , and is a series highlight . Kolchak never got any better . Timeless .  
  This movie is stuffed full of stock Horror movie goodies : chained lunatics , pre-meditated murder , a mad ( vaguely lesbian ) female scientist with an even madder father who wears a mask because of his horrible disfigurement , poisoning , spooky castles , werewolves ( male and female ) , adultery , slain lovers , Tibetan mystics , the half-man / half-plant victim of some unnamed experiment , grave robbing , mind control , walled up bodies , a car crash on a lonely road , electrocution , knights in armour - the lot , all topped off with an incredibly awful score and some of the worst Foley work ever done . The script is incomprehensible ( even by badly dubbed Spanish Horror movie standards ) and some of the editing is just bizarre . In one scene where the lead female evil scientist goes to visit our heroine in her bedroom for one of the badly dubbed : " That is fantastical . I do not understand . Explain to me again how this is .. " exposition scenes that litter this movie , there is a sudden hand held cutaway of the girl 's thighs as she gets out of bed for no apparent reason at all other than to cover a cut in the bad scientist 's " Mwahaha ! All your werewolfs belong mine ! " speech . Though why they went to the bother I don't know because there are plenty of other jarring jump cuts all over the place - even allowing for the atrocious pan and scan of the print I saw . The Director was , according to one interview with the star , drunk for most of the shoot and the film looks like it . It is an incoherent mess . It 's made even more incoherent by the inclusion of werewolf rampage footage from a different film The Mark of the Wolf Man ( made 4 years earlier , featuring the same actor but playing the part with more aggression and with a different shirt and make up - IS there a word in Spanish for " Continuity " ? ) and more padding of another actor in the wolfman get-up ambling about in long shot . The music is incredibly bad varying almost at random from full orchestral creepy house music , to bosannova , to the longest piano and gong duet ever recorded . ( Thinking about it , it might not have been a duet . It might have been a solo . The piano part was so simple it could have been picked out with one hand while the player whacked away at the gong with the other . ) This is one of the most bewilderedly trance-state inducing bad movies of the year so far for me . Enjoy . Favourite line : " Ilona ! This madness and perversity will turn against you ! " How true . Favourite shot : The lover , discovering his girlfriend slain , dropping the candle in a cartoon-like demonstration of surprise . Rank amateur directing there .  
  I remembered seeing this movie when i was a kid one day on the wonderful world of Disney . This movie has been in my memory for over 30 years and I have been looking for it . I would have to say that out of all the kids movies I saw back then , this one stuck out more than all of them and after only seeing it once , I really hoped I would get to see it again . The story and images of this movie have been burned into my memory . To this day , I never did see it after that day back in the 70s , in fact , I never remembered the title until an internet search earlier today disclosed it to me . I loved it and want my kids to see it . Does anybody know where I can find it ?  
  Japan 1918 . The story of 16-year old Ryu begins with the death of her father . As it will be revealed later , both of her parents have died of tuberculosis . In this desperate situation Ryus aunt has arranged a marriage with a Japanese man in Hawai , whom they know only from its picture . By her arrival in Hawai ryu discovers that her new husband is much older as in the photograph , and that he lives in very humble circumstances beside a sugar cane plantage were he works on . Ryu not used to the hard labour on the plantage and in despair over her situation in her new home thinks of running away . She soon discovers that she has nowhere to go . The friendship to Kana , a female co-worker of hers , gives her new hope and strength . This picture is based on real events between 1907 and the 1920s , when thousands of Asian woman were married off to men in America , whom they only knew from their picture . This not very well known picture is well written and acted . The location is breathtaking . This film also features Mifune Toshiro in his very last screen appearance as a Benshi ( narrator of silent movies ) . This film gives some insight of Japanese culture here and across the ocean . A must see !  
  Great little thriller . I was expecting some type of silly horror movie but what I got was tight short thriller that waste none of our time . Mostof these movies we have to get into the back characters stories so we will either feel sympathy for them or hatred when people start getting killed . o such foolishness here . Yes you see a few characters but they really only interact with the principals . Such as the husband wife at the motel whose room was canceled . We saw them so we could just how efficient the Lisa character was and how inefficient the new Hotel clerk was . We see the little girl simply because she will have a very small but important role later in the movie when all heck breaks loose . THe Flight Atrendants because we need on in particular to move the plot ahead . The bad guy in particular needs her in the beginning of the flight . The rude guy in the airport was important to the movie too . The only 2 characters that were just 5 liners with no use to the plot were the two young guys on the plane . THat was clever because I thought they would have something to do with plot . From the first scene to the last the woman character a young hotel executive named Lisa is in charge . Even when Jackson shows his true colors she doesn't panic . She thinks what she can do to stall time . Any other movie the smart executive women would be acting like idiots . But not this one . It was a very short movie and I was waiting for the usual plot devices to kick in because the movie seemed to be coming to its conclusion fast . Thankfuly none of them were used . The new hotel clerk did not do the usual called and told her what to do , which is panic drop the phone and run out of the hotel without saying anything , or question your boss and tell her she had to much to drink and just dismiss her . Was Craven should do more of these types of movies . Also one last comment . Brian Cox is in the movie but I had not one clue who he was . I had to come over here to see that he is Lisa 's father . He is completely unrecognizable .  
  This is an excellent , fast paced thriller by Wes Craven ( Nightmare on Elm Street ) , who for 85 minutes leaves aside the supernatural and presents us with something even more terrifying - the evil of human beings . We are far more likely to encounter the benign evil of Jackson Rippner than Freddy Kruger , and Cillian Murphy ( Batman Begins ) does an excellent job of presenting a sociable , friendly , even charismatic killer . The performances by Murphy and by Rachel McAdams ( Claire , from The Wedding Crashers ) are brilliant . Most of the film takes place on a very intimate level , between two people , their eyes , their faces . It is action on a small scale , not the broad sweep of the canvas , and it is no less compelling for these limitations . The cinematography is nothing special , though of course one can do only so much with a camera in the confines of a passenger jet , but the dialog is excellent , the story taut . There are no distractions , no subplots confuse the issue which is at its heart a battle between the main characters . By keeping his focus and avoiding distractions , Wes Craven is able to take what is a very minimal plot and turning it into an exciting , fast-paced action thriller .  
  This show is awesome ! I have been a fan since it premiered , and it only keeps me watching .. I 've seen some terrible things here , that I wish I hadn't , BUT , it really shows you how addiction affects all involved , not just the addict . You can see all kinds of different addictions , from drugs and alcohol to the shopping addict , or the eating disorder addict . And actually , it 's really sad to see some of the famous faces that have come through also . We 've seen accomplished musicians , an NBA player , and even young people , who really need the help . And since they have started showing a few follow-ups , that 's been awesome too . Now , you can see how they are a long while after their ep aired . If you haven't checked this one out , please do . It 's on A & E , and it 's awesome ! The new eps are Sunday nights at 10PM EST , if I remember correctly .. so set your TiVo !  
  I can give you four reasons to see this movie : 1 . Four of the best filmmakers in the contemporary Mexican cinema . 2 . Four good stories , related into a big scheme . 3 . A surprisingly good cast . 4 . A bitter reflexion about the biggest trouble in this country ( and many others ) . ( POSSIBLE SPOILERS ) Alejandro Gamboa opens this movie with a good story in a comedic mood about the authority practicing the extortion against regular people and still expecting to be appreciated by its efforts . Then Antonio Serrano gets more dramatic in the second piece with a story heir to the Italian neorealism with a " Peter and the wolf " - like anecdote . In the third story , the one that seems more independent from this series even in the context , Carlos Carrera tells us the story of a man being at the wrong place in the wrong moment . But after the recent lynching at Tlahuac and the tradition in this awful matter at the State of Mexico , this story couldn't be more updated . And at the end , Fernando Sariñana returns to the dark humor in the " grand finale " in which he puts together the most of the characters from the past sequences in one of the better comedy pieces ever filmed . Reprising the center scene from one of his previous films " Todo el poder " , Sariñana gives the final lesson of the theme . And by the way , give us the scene that steals the movie with Anna Ciochetti making a brief striptease . Once the movie has ended , you get a bittersweet feeling about having looked at a good movie ( and maybe enjoyed it ) with a very painful subject . They say that in Mexico people laugh at their own disgrace and this is the best example . This film is a testimony of how Mexicans have learn to live in the middle of a crime state ( and perhaps accepted it ) , between two fires : The criminals and the so-called authorities full of corruption . Even this movie is a wishful thinking because almost all the good people have been a victim of crime and they don't get this unhurt . If you had an assault without a scratch then you 're lucky . Meanwhile , don't lose the chance to see this movie , highly recommended . And it 's a beautiful life in Mexico ..  
  This is such a great film ! Never mind the low rating here . I really have no idea where that came from , they must be discussing a different film then . Because I absolutely loved it and found it to be a little hidden treasure . It 's story was so original and charming .. I really can't think of anything bad to say about it . Maybe it has to be ' your type of thing ' , but , I saw this with my sister and my mother , and we all were taken by it . The acting was also very good , and that is hard to do in a film like this . But I found all the characters very intriguing and sympathetic . I 've always been very fond of Dougray Scott and found his new ' dark ' role very interesting . It is really awful hard to get me to like a bad guy , but I absolutely had no problem with that this time . Even more so , I adored him . Everyone who loves a good thriller / drama that also has a good dose of love and tragedy should definitely go see this film , no question about that ! Anyone wanting to see a film with 80 % bloodshed , should go rent something else , though .. But I guess the title already kind of gives that away . This is a love story , not Saw 3 . I give this film 4 out of five stars ! Good job ! xx Enjoy !  
  " Why did they make them so big ? Why didn't they just give the money to the poor ? " The question about cathedrals was asked by a student to Mr . Harvey during a school field trip to Salisbury Cathedral . " That 's a good question , " he replied . " Partly to inspire them - to get them to look up with awe . " I 'm not sure that cathedrals have that impact on everyone , but this movie certainly had that impact on me . It was awesome ! It didn't start out that way . For a while it seemed to be little more than a depiction of - well - a school field trip to Salisbury Cathedral . If you 've ever been on a high school field trip to anywhere this is basically it . You have a group of largely disinterested kids just happy to be out of school for a day , the bus driver who 's driven crazy by them and some teachers trying desperately to keep it all under control . Been there , done that , got the t-shirt was my initial reaction . I figured that in the end this was going to be a typical story of a teacher managing to inspire a group of disinterested students . YAWN ! But it turns out to be so much more ! Timothy Spall was brilliant as Mr . Harvey - a sombre , unsmiling teacher with a strange fascination for cathedrals . Over the course of the movie , his story slowly comes out and becomes the focal point of the story . We also get introduced to some of the troubled students - most notably Helen , also brilliantly played by Nathalie Press , who 's into self-mutilation . This isn't a religious movie , but it includes some powerful reflections on religious themes . When Harvey 's colleague Jonathon ( played by Ben Miles ) says " I don't care what anyone believes as long as they don't try to force it on anyone else " Harvey replies , " that isn't tolerance - it 's indifference ! " - which is , in fact ( in my opinion ) what often passes for religious tolerance in our society . There are scenes of reconciliation between various characters , and the final scene of the movie was brilliant . As Harvey climbs back on the bus , director Susanna White has the camera slowly pan upwards , so that the final shot is simply of the sky - hearkening back to Harvey 's comment that the purpose of the cathedral is to get people to look up in awe . The cathedral accomplishes its goal . We look up into the universe in awe , seeking something greater than ourselves , however we choose to define it . This is a very powerful and very inspiring movie . 9/10  
  Amazing acting , music . A simple and clear plot but it drew me in and kept me captivated all the way through . I don't know why it was so fantastic but it simply was . So many of the characters were so real . It moved me and made me think I would like to watch more like this . The idea of a school trip as a forum for such an amazing plot was a genius idea and so many of the people were like people were like those encountered every day by teachers in the classroom . The film tackles issues of religion , prejudice , drugs friendship , memories , difficult experiences and simple the diversity of life itself .  
  I will never forget this film or the events that lead up to Jonestown in Guyana . It just seems so tragic but needs to be told . Powers Boothe give a commanding performance as the leader Rev . Jim Jones from obscurity until total madness . It would have won him an Academy Award easily if it was released in the movie theaters . It is the kind of mini-series you won't forget . You won't forget the images of the cult 's brutality , control , and obsessiveness of it 's leader . His rise and fall and the threat from the outside world to destroy what he considered to be paradise . The mass suicide is horrifying , almost unreal to anybody 's imagination as to why so many people ( 900 + ) went willingly or resisted JOnes ' orders . They don't make mini series like these anymore where we 're left with out mouths open and hungry to know what happened to the others .  
  " Sasquatch Hunters " actually wasn't as bad as I thought . * SPOILERS * Traveling into the woods , Park Rangers Charles Landon , ( Kevin O'Connor ) Roger Gordon , ( Matt Latimore ) Brian Stratton ( David Zelina ) Spencer Combs , ( Rick Holland ) and his sister Janet , ( Stacey Branscombe ) escort Dr . Helen Gilbert , ( Amy Shelton-White ) her boss Dr . Ethan Edwards , ( Gary Sturm ) and assistant Louise Keaton , ( Juliana Dever ) to find the site of some reputed bones found in the area . When they make camp , the team discovers a giant burial ground and more strange bones littering the area . When members of the group start to disappear , they start to wander through the woods to safety . It 's discovered that a Sasquatch is behind the killings , and the team band together to survive . The Good News : This wasn't as bad as I thought it would be . The movie really starts to pick up some steam at around the half-way point , when the creature attacks . That is a masterful series of scenes , as the whole group is subjected to attacks by the creature , and the suspense throughout the entire play-out is extremely high . The wooded area is most appropriately milked during these parts , heightening the tension and wondering when a single person wandering around in the forest will get their comeuppance . Also spread quite liberally through the movie is the effective use of off-screen growls and roars that are truly unworldly . They really do add much to make this part so creepy , as well as the other times the growling shriek is heard . It 's quite effective , and works well . It 's quite nice that the later part of the film picks up the pace , as it goes out pretty well on a high note of action . One scene especially I feel must point out as being a special scene on first viewing . As a man is running through the forest from the creature , he spots the expedition that has gone on looking for it . Raising his hands to holler to them for help , the second he goes to announce his presence is he attacked from out of nowhere and killed quite hastily . It caught me by surprise and actually gave me a little jump on first viewing . The Bad News : There was only a couple things to complain about here , and one is a usual complaint . The creature here is mostly rendered by horrible CGI , which made him look totally ridiculous and destroys any credibility it might 've had . The air of menace conjured up by the opening of the film is almost shot out the window when the creature appears on screen . It 's so distracting that it 's a shame a little more work wasn't put into it . I 've complained about this one a lot , and is something that really should be done away with , as it doesn't look that realistic and is quite fake . Another big one is the off-screen kills in here . Very often in the film is a person grabbed and then yanked away , and then finding the bloody body afterward . It 's quite aggravating when the kills look nice and juicy afterward . Otherwise , I don't really have much of a problem with this one , as everything else that 's usually critiqued about this one didn't really bother me , but it is called on for others beyond this stuff . The Final Verdict : I kinda liked this one , but it 's still not the best Sasquatch movie ever . It 's not supposed to be taken seriously , and if viewed that way , it 's actually quoit enjoyable . Fans of these films should give this one a look , and those that like the Sci-Fi Creature Features might find some nice things in here as well . Rated R : Graphic Language , Violence and some graphic carcasses  
  This animated movie is a masterpiece ! The narration , music , animation , and storyline where all remarkable . My girlfriend and I saw it again for a second time and we got more insight from it . We invited a couple friends to see Spirit with us and they really enjoyed it a lot . When I asked them to come along to see it , they thought it was a movie about horses , but afterwards they realized it was more than that . I liked Esperanza , Spirit , Rain , and Lil ' Creek , who reminds me of Nathan Chasing Horse who is Smiles A Lot in Dances With Wolves . Spirit has deep symbolic meanings and metaphors that I found to be empowering and inspirational . I saw Spirit for a third time and I want to go see it again . I enjoyed " Spirit " tremendously because its portrayal of American Indians is realistic , dignified , and non-stereotypical unlike the movie " The Road to El Dorado " , which was a total farce because it portrayed American Indians in a disrespectful and stereotypical way . But Dreamworks has redeemed themselves by making Spirit a great movie that I found to be acceptable ! I hope they continue to make more animated movies like Spirit , and I would like to see sequels or spinoffs to Spirit if its done respectfully and without stereotyping American Indians . I highly recommend this to others who have an open mind to go and pay to see Spirit : Stallion of the Cimarron .  
  I thought this movie would be dumb , but I really liked it . People I know hate it because Spirit was the only horse that talked . Well , so what ? The songs were good , and the horses didn't need to talk to seem human . I wouldn't care to own the movie , and I would love to see it again . 8/10  
  Robert Taylor as the mad buffalo hunter Charlie Gilson is the main character in this film . At the beginning I was thinking that Charlie would end up redeeming himself like John Wayne in The Searchers or James Stewart in The Naked Spur . But as the film goes along Gilson keeps doing more atrocities until you realize there is no hope for him . Stewart Granger is Sandy McKenzie , who wants to stop hunting because he realizes that the buffaloes will soon be gone and he becomes disgusted by the act of killing . Gilson is a natural killer who makes no distinction between animals or human beings . Debra Paget as the Indian girl is a surprising character considering the self imposed censorship of that time . She lies with Gilson in total resignation even though she hates him . The last scene of a frozen Gilson , is unforgettable .  
  In the funeral of the famous British journalist Joe Strombel ( Ian McShane ) , his colleagues and friends recall how obstinate he was while seeking for a scoop . Meanwhile the deceased Joe discloses the identity of the tarot card serial killer of London . He cheats the Reaper and appears to the American student of journalism Sondra Pransky ( Scarlett Johansson ) , who is on the stage in the middle of a magic show of the magician Sidney Waterman ( Woody Allen ) in London , and tells her that the murderer is the aristocrat Peter Lyman ( Hugh Jackman ) . Sondra drags Sid in her investigation , seeking for evidences that Peter is the killer . However , she falls in love with him and questions if Joe Strombel is right in his scoop . " Scoop " is another great Woody Allen 's comedy outside Manhattan , actually again in London . His ironic and witty lines are simply fantastic , and I laughed a lot inclusive with his fate of hero in a country where people drive " in the wrong side " . Sid Waterman is extremely funny and Woody Allen is in an excellent shape as comedian . However , his present muse Scarlett Johansson , of whom I am a big fan , has over-acting and is annoying in many moments , changing inclusive her accent to a histrionic pronunciation . Her character is absolutely silly and promiscuous , and I was quite disappointed with her performance ( probably for the first time in her filmography ) . But this supernatural comedy is still a hilarious and worthwhile entertainment . My vote is eight . Title ( Brazil ) : " Scoop  O Grande Furo " ( " Scoop  The Big Scoop " )  
  I really thought they did an * excellent * job , there was nothing wrong with it at all , I don't know how the first commenter could have said it was terrible , it moved me to tears ( I guess it moved about everyone to tears ) but I try not to cry in a movie because it 's embarrassing but this one got me . It was SOO good ! I hope they release it on DVD because I will definitely buy a copy ! I feel like it renewed my faith and gave me a hope that I can't explain , it made me want to strive to be a better person , they went through so much and we kind of take that for granted , I guess . Compared to that , I feel like our own trials are nothing . Well , not nothing , but they hardly match what they had to go through . I loved it . Who played Emma ? !  
  This is a plain old spooky ghost story . I showed it to some friends of mine in my movie club , and they were kept spellbound until the ending ! No blood or gore - just good old fashioned suspense . It starts out right from the beginning , and builds and builds . The ending is a real twist that caught me unawares . Well directed and well acted . It is also a " period piece " - set in the 1920s - which added to the atmosphere . I was so impressed I got the book by Susan Hill from Amazon . The movie follows the book rather closely . It 's a shame it 's not readily available on DVD . My copy is VHS . This along with " Haunted " are probably two of the best Ghost Stories I 've ever scene . Which just goes to show that a little creativity outdoes " in your face " gore any day !  
  I love ghost stories in general , but I PARTICULARLY LOVE chilly , atmospheric and elegantly creepy British period-style ghost stories . This one qualifies on all counts . A naive young lawyer ( " solicitor " in Britspeak ) is sent to a small village near the seaside to settle an elderly , deceased woman 's estate . It 's the 1920s , a time when many middle-class Brits go to the seaside on vacation for " their health . " Well , guess what , there 's nothing " healthy " about the village of Crythin Gifford , the creepy site of the elderly woman 's hulking , brooding Victorian estate , which is located on the fringes of a fog-swathed salt marsh . When the lawyer saves the life of a small girl ( none of the locals will help the endangered tot - you find out why later on in the film ) , he inadvertently incurs the wrath of a malevolent spirit , the woman in black . She is no filmy , gauzy wraith , but a solid black silhouette of malice and evil . The viewer only sees her a few times , but you feel her malevolent presence in every frame . As the camera creeps up on the lawyer while he 's reading through legal papers , you expect to see the woman in black at any moment . When the lawyer goes out to the generator shed to turn on the electricity for the creepy old house , the camera snakes in on him and you think she 'll pop up there , too . Waiting for the woman in black to show up is nail-bitingly suspenseful . We 've seen many elements of this story before ( the locked room that no one enters , the fog , the naive outsider who ignores the locals ' warnings ) but the director somehow manages to combine them all into a completely new-seeming and compelling ghost story . Watch it with a buddy so you can have someone warm to grab onto while waiting for the woman in black . . .  
  The Woman in Black ( 1989 ) is a TV adaptation of Susan Hill 's modern classic ghost story , published only a few years earlier than the film was made . Sadly , this film has not been released on DVD , and as far as I am aware it has been deleted on VHS . It 's availability is in direct contrast to it 's popularity amongst those in the know about horror films . The story revolves around events in a seaside community in the early 20th century where a young solicitor is sent by his firm to conclude the affairs of a recently deceased widow , who died on her isolated marshland estate . What he thought would be a routine and probably tedious task turns into a nightmare as he discovers that the old woman was haunted to her death , and that the ghosts of her past are not content to rest . The story is told in a subtle but concise way , never being self-indulgent , flashy or over-expositional . The obviously tight budget may have contributed to the no-nonsense approach , but it 's just what the story needs , and why it works so well . It 's what you don't see that scares . Having said that , there is one particularly terrifying scene that relies on the visual , and it works to perfection . I watched this film during the day , and it still gave me nightmares nearly a week later . If you love being terrified , do what you must to get hold of and watch a copy of The Woman In Black .  
  This movie is great , the music " with the exception of the very first song in the movie " was awesome . The story line is awesome too , it 's just basically a wonderfull movie , for ALL ages . I found the last battle scene awesome ! Basically this was a great flick !  
  Greatly enjoyed this 1945 mystery thriller film about a young woman , Nina Foch , ( Julia Ross ) who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work . Julia reads an ad in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position . Julia obtains the position and is hired by a Mrs . Hughes , ( Dame May Witty ) who requires that she lives with her employer in her home and wants her to have no involvement with men friends and Julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote her entire time to this job . George Macready , ( Ralph Hughes ) is the son of Mrs . Hughes and has some very strange desires for playing around with knives . This was a low budget film and most of the scenes were close ups in order to avoid the expense of a background and costs for scenery . This strange family all live in a huge mansion off the Cornwall Coast of England and there is secret doors and plenty of suspense .  
  The story is somewhat stilted , what with the main character 's sudden reversals of fortune , but Leslie Howard and Bette Davis 's portrayals of Philip Carey , the naïve obsessed lover and Mildred Rogers , the unworthy object of his affections , raise this film considerably above standard melodrama . Sensitive , cultured Philip , who for most of the picture is in bondage to first his infatuation and then his pity for Mildred is not unlike a character Howard was to play a few years later-Ashley Wilkes , the Southern gentleman too refined and decent to make it in the rough Reconstruction era . Philip in fact seems resigned to disappointment even before Mildred enters the picturehe doesn't even seem particularly surprised when his art teacher tells him he 'll never make it as a painter . It is perhaps this passivity , these lowered expectations that makes him put up with the selfish Cockney waitress for as long as he does . Although Leslie Howard is memorable , today " Of Human Bondage " is mainly thought of as a Bette Davis picture , perhaps because of the well known story of how she had to fight Jack Warner to get the part of Mildred , and perhaps too because movie audiences tend to prefer characters with her sort of brash energy . Mildred may have a grating voice , but she also has the ethereal beauty of a stained glass angel , making it somewhat understandable why Philip let himself be strung along for as long as he did . Although man eating Mildred may at times seem one dimensional , she does evoke sympathy in the viewer from time to time as when she becomes ill and belatedly realizes that Philip is the only decent man who ever cared for her . One may also think she is on to something when she accuses Philip of looking down on her for not being " fine " enough . ( The scene in which Philip and Norah dismiss romance magazines as trash for kitchen maids seems to confirm this ) . Most of the supporting characters are also effective , particularly Norah the sensible romance writer who loves Philip but knows she can never compete with Mildred and Sally who has Mildred 's beauty and Norah 's decency and emerges as the deserving woman Philip is rewarded with in the end . The only character I found hollow was Sally 's eccentric , ale slurping aristocratic father who seems like a stock character from an earlier era . A classic that deserves it reputation .  
  i got to see the whole movie last night and i found it very exciting . it was at least , not like the teen-slasher movies that pop out every now and then . the search for the killer and the ' partner ' relationship between the hero & the so-called bad guy was parts i liked about the movie . also , i remember once being on the edge of my seat during a specific scene in the movie . i mean it 's exciting . maybe some time later , i might watch the movie again ..  
  Kate Beckinsale is as good if not better than Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma in this movie , although I really liked Gwyneth Paltrow in the other Emma version . They 're both good in different ways . Kate Beckinsale as Emma seems more interesting , almost , though . And I liked the woman who played Harriet Smith in this movie better , too .. she was more believably sweet and sentimental . There are certain things I like better about the Gwyneth Paltrow version , though , like how the humorous side is more apparent .  
  Rumour has it that around the time that ABBA  the multi-award winning Swedish disco favourites  's star had reached its zenith , the band grew disillusioned with singing in English and yearned to perform in their native tongue . Soon after , problems began to emerge in the onetime-wed locked-watertight partnership and recordings became less and less frequent . The band dissolved , albeit unofficially , in 1982 and pop lost one of its most celebrated artists . Although they have never admitted that there 's any truth in those rumours , the fact remains that ABBA would never have been so successful had they only recorded in their native tongue . If you want to appeal to the largest money-making media market in the entire world , then you must cater for English speaking audiences . It 's amazing for me how such a small island that 's located a stone-throw away from the European continent could have created perhaps the most recognised , although not most widely spoken , language in the world . Everyone speaks a little bit of English ; whether it be simply ' hello ' or a common swear word - you 'll find an English speaker almost everywhere . Pedro Galindo obviously didn't agree , because Trampa Infernal was never subtitled for global consumption until it was released recently on budget DVD . That 's a real shame , because it 's actually a decent slasher movie that 's a lot better than many of its English-speaking genre compatriots . The film launches in the somewhat unfamiliar territory of a pistol duel . Two unidentified characters are shown sneaking around a dilapidated complex searching out one another for the inevitable final showdown . After some suspense and a couple of near misses , one of the pistoleers emerges victoriously . Next we learn that they were only paintball guns and the two competitors are actually youngsters from the local town . Nacho and Mauricio are fiercest rivals and Mauricio is always trying to prove himself to be better than his soft-spoken opponent , but as of yet he hasn't succeeded . Later that night , whilst the victorious gunslinger celebrates his triumph with his girlfriend Alejandra and his buddy Charly , Mauricio enters the bar and says that he has one last challenge for his glorious nemesis . He says that this will be the competition that will prove to the town once and for all who deserves the uttermost respect . Nacho is at first reluctant because Alejandra warns him of the perils of continual competitiveness , but he eventually succumbs to the weight of peer pressure and agrees ; much to the distaste of his morally superior partner . They plan to head out to the remote region of Filo de Caballo , because recent press coverage has reported that numerous people have been butchered by what locals believe to be a vicious bear . Mauricio proposes that whoever murders the animal can be regarded as the greatest and he also promises that it will be the last battle that he wages against his adversary . After visiting the armoury to stock up on weapons and ignoring the warnings of the elderly store-keeper , the group set out to the remoteness of the secluded woodland . Hunters become hunted as they learn that the ' bear ' is actually a homicidal Vietnam vet who is still unaware that the war has ended and considers all humans as his enemy . What started as a competitive adventure suddenly becomes a battle for survival as they are stalked and slaughtered by the malevolent assassin . I picked up Trampa whilst studying in Madrid from a Mexican student who lived in the dorm room next-door to me . I remember that the copy I watched was faulty and the tape ended about 10 minutes before the final credits rolled , which meant I never got to see the final scenes . Thankfully I came across the budget DVD recently on Amazon and immediately added it to my collection . Gallindo 's slasher is a surprisingly good effort that excels from its skillful direction and enthusiastic plot , which attempts to cover areas not usually approached by slasher movies . It is in fact so good that it reminded me on more than one occasion of the Arnold Schwarzenegger classic Predator . This is especially evident in the scenes that show the creepily-masked assassin jogging through the forest and stalking the panic-stricken troupe as they struggle to escape the maniac 's playground . Despite Gallindo 's obvious awareness of genre platitudes ( the bogeyman even uses a claw-fingered glove a la Freddy Kruegar ) ; Trampa also attempts to add something different to the standard template . Whilst the majority of the runtime plays by the concrete rules of the category , the final third heralds a significant step in individuality as the maniac arms himself with a machine gun and entices the hero to his lair for the final showdown . From here on , the film rapidly swaps genres and becomes almost an action film , which depending on your taste will either excite or disappoint you . The last slasher that tried to crossbreed the two styles was that shoddy eighties entry ' The Majorettes ' , which is not necessarily a good thing . As is the case with many Latin films ( especially Spanish flicks by Almodovar and Amenabar ) , Trampa has a subtle undercurrent of a moral to its story , which is conveyed successfully without being rammed down the viewer 's throat . Over indulge in the temptations of competitive masculinity and you may not always be the winner . It 's a sugar-coated point , but it 's handled delicately enough not to detract from the fun of the feature . Trampa may be cheesy , but it deserves to be seen and recognised as one of the better late slashers . The killer looks great in creepy army fatigues and white Valentine-style mask and the attempts at originality just about work . It may lack the gore that most sincere horror fans enjoy , but it has enough in terms of suspense and creativity to warrant at least one viewing .  
  Maybe it 's because I saw the movie before reading the book , but I really love this movie . I 've seen it many many times and will be watching it many times more . It 's a compelling story , that 's interesting from the beginning to the end . It has everything : action , romance etc .  
  I caught this movie on my local movie channel , and i rather enjoyed watching the film . It has all the elements of a good teen film , and more - this film , aside from dealing with boys-girls relationships and sex and the like , also deals with the issue of steroid use by young people . The film has that real-life feel to it - no loud music , no special effects and no outrageous scenes - which , for this movie , was right . That feel makes it easy to relate to the characters in the film - some of which we probably know from where we live . Overall , a good movie , fun to watch . 8/10  
  I love this movie , Jouvet , Arletty , Blier , Carné .. almost everything has already been said about the movie , but there is one detail I 'd like to shed some light onto : no footage of the real , still standing , Hôtel du Nord ( is it still ? I heard it was to be demolished .. ) has been used for the movie - the whole scene has been rebuilt on set , the main reason being that they could not stop the traffic on the St Martin canal for several weeks .  
  I had started to lose my faith in films of recent being inundated with the typical Genre Hollywood film . Story lines fail , and camera work is merely copied from the last film of similiar taste . But , then I saw Zentropa ( Europa ) and my faith was renewed . Not only is the metaphorical storyline enthralling but the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating . The narrator ( Max Von Sydow ) takes you through a spellbounding journey every step of the way and engrosses you into Europa 1945 . We have all seen death put on screen in a hundred thousand ways but the beauty of this film is how it takes you through every slow-moving moment that leads you to death . Unlike many films it doesn't cut after one second of showing ( for example ) a knife but forces you to watch the devastating yet sensuous beauty of a man 's final moments . I think we can all take something different away from what this movie is trying to say but it is definitely worth taking the time to find out what it all really means . I would love to talk more in depth about the film for any one who wishes to send me an email . Enjoy it !  
  A Chinese Ghost Story stars the late , great Leslie Cheung as Ling Choi Sin , a penniless tax collector who decides to spend the night at a deserted temple , where he meets and falls for a beautiful woman called Tsing ( Joey Wang ) . When Ling discovers that Tsing is actually a ghost who has been forced to seduce victims for an evil tree spirit who feeds on ' chi ' ( life force ) , he decides to try and free the girl by giving her remains a proper burial . Enlisting the help of Swordsman Yin ( Wu ma ) , a crazy Taoist monk , Ling successfully defeats the tree spirit , but must also do battle in hell against the evil Lord Black , to whom Tsing is due to be wed . The first Hong Kong film that I saw which wasn't purely martial arts action , A Chinese Ghost Story opened my eyes to the incredible world of Asian fantasy horror , a magical realm inhabited by beautiful female ghosts , bumbling innocent heroes , sword wielding Taoist monks , monstrous spirits , and dark lords of the underworld ; I instantly fell in love with the film 's exuberance , energy , humour , inventiveness and visual excellence . Two decades later , and this amazing movie still remains one of the finest examples of its genre that I have seena sumptuous , breathtaking masterpiece that brilliantly blends horror , comedy , fantasy and romance . With superb direction from Siu-Tung Ching , excellent editing from David Wu , stunning cinematography , and a whole slew of imaginative special effects ( including a humongous killer tongue , a many tentacled monster , and multiple flying heads ! ) , A Chinese Ghost Story is a completely unforgettable and thoroughly enjoyable experience from start to finish .  
  A masterpiece of comedy , a masterpiece of horror , a masterpiece of romance , if there is anything negative to say about A Chinese Ghost Story , it might be that the special effects looked dated in comparison to modern technology . The film has a simple premise : a poor debt collector has to stay in a secluded area while trying to collect a debt . Of course , it happens to be haunted as well . What I wasn't expecting the first time I saw this film is that it 's one of the most touching love stories I 've ever seen ; that is without losing any of the slapstick comedy that will have you in stitches . Unlike some films of Asian cinema , A Chinese Ghost Story isn't hard to swallow for those that aren't versed in Chinese culture . Indeed , it plays on timeless , cultureless themes of the paranormal and romance . Think Evil Dead 2 , if they had thrown a wonderful love story into the mix . This film is for real , despite being overlooked by many . It 's absolutely among the best I 've ever seen . It 's ability to combine the best aspects of multiple genres , and cross cultural boundaries in order to appeal to humanity everywhere , is nothing short of fantastic . Highly recommended , 10/10 .  
  Warning : contains a spoiler . Corny plot and in many cases terrible acting . Fontaine is great , but some others , particularly Richard Ney , Ivy 's husband , are exceedingly wooden . Ney lies in bed , dying of arsenical poisoning , with every hair in place . Yet the movie is so juicy and so suspenseful . More faithful to the book than most movies of its era . Casting Joan Fontaine as a poisoner ( and an adulteress , which was just as shocking then - I 'm not kidding , kids ) was a masterful stroke . She 's just her usual Joan Fontainey self . As murderers were supposed to , she dies by falling " feet foremost through the floor into an empty space . "  
  This is a very fine and poetic story . Beautiful scenery . Magnificent music score . I 've been twice in Japan last year and the movie gave me this typical Japanese feeling . The movement of the camera is superb , as well as the actors . It goes deep into your feelings without becoming melodramatic . Japanese people are very sensitive and kind and it 's all very well brought onto the screen here . The director is playing superb with light an colors and shows the audience that it is also possible to let them enjoy a movie with subtle and fine details . Once you 've seen this movie you will want to see more from the same director . It 's a real feel good movie and I can only recommend it to everybody .  
  I grew up watching this movie , and I still love it just as much today as when i was a kid . Don't listen to the critic reviews . They are not accurate on this film . Eddie Murphy really shines in his roll . You can sit down with your whole family and everybody will enjoy it . I recommend this movie to everybody to see . It is a comedy with a touch of fantasy . With demons , dragons , and a little bald kid with God like powers . This movie takes you from L.A. to Tibet , of into the amazing view of the wondrous temples of the mountains in Tibet . Just a beautiful view ! So go do your self a favor and snatch this one up ! You wont regret it !  
  I 'm surprised that no one yet has mentioned that there are two versions of this same film . The lion 's share of the footage in both is identical , but here is where they differ : In one version ( the version I have seen most often on broadcast TV ) , the group of clerics guarding the gateway consists of the " Brotherhood of the Protectors " , a ( fictional ) splinter group of priests and brothers " excommunicated " by the Church . In the other version , which I 've seen only once on TV , the clerics guarding the gateway are depicted as priests of the official Church , meaning the Archdiocese of New York ( or perhaps Brooklyn ) . Also , in the former version , in most of the pertinent scenes , the clerics are referred to as " brothers " ( and in some scenes , you can see where the lips say " Father " so-and-so but the dubbed audio says " Brother " so-and-so . In the latter version , I believe everyone is referred to as " Father " . In any event , it seems that one of these two versions is more or less a partial re-shooting of the other , with all " Brotherhood of the Protector " scenes re-shot as " Archdiocese " scenes , or vice versa . ( Kind of reminds me of the Raymond Burr cutaway scenes in " Godzilla " ) . I have videotaped both versions off broadcast TV , so no , I 'm not imagining this . Can anyone shed some more light on the story behind these two versions of the film ?  
  In the hands of a more skilled director , this film would have been considered a horror masterpiece . Despite Michael " Death Wish " Winner 's merely passable direction , the movie is interesting , original and more than a little scary . The script bucks more than one horror cliché off its back ( several it can't shake ) including Chris Sarandon as the heroine 's boyfriend who actually listens to her as she insists that eerie things are going down . Burgess Meredith is delightful as the lovably insane neighbor . Eva Gardner is haunting with a young Beverly D'Angelo as her mute and disturbed lesbian lover . John Carradine does a heck-of-a job sitting in a chair . And watch out for a brief cameo from an unknown at the time Chris Walken ! This movie is creepy and creative . The plot twists are lovely , if a tad predictable . The climax , of which I will give no detail , is disturbing and quite impressive . Again a better director could have done more with it , nonetheless it is quite satisfying - at least to those with the sensibilities of seventies horror . If you like modern overproduced body-counting torture-fantasy , you won't like this . There is almost no gore . The direction is quite spartan . The effects are few , although there 's some delightful makeup near the end - most of which actually isn't makeup .. but perhaps I 've said too much already . I 've rated this a little higher than its quality may justify , but I enjoyed it as much as any " 8 " film that I 've seen .  
  I was pleased to see that she had black hair ! I 've been a fan for about 30 years now and have been disgusted at the two earlier attempts to film the stories . I was pleased that the screenwriters updated the period to include a computer , it didn't spoil it at all . In fact I watched the film twice in one day , a sure sign that it was up to standard . This is what I do with books that I like as well . I thought all the characters were well depicted and represented the early days of Modesty Blaise extremely well as evinced in both book and comic strip . I would also have to disagree with a comment made by an earlier reviewer about baddies having to be ugly . Has he actually read the books ? I thought this was a very good film and look forward to sequels with anticipation .  
  The premise may seem goofy , but since Murphy 's character doesn't take it seriously , it helps ease the audience into this mix of mysticism and modern-day hard-boiled child abduction . Excellent cast , particularly Charles Dance and Charlotte Lewis , and Murphy is at the height of his 80 's peak in comedy / action . There 's also some great F / X , a very surreal dream sequence , and a fairly original plot . Often overlooked in the pantheon of Murphy flicks , but this one is worth a look .  
  This is a very dramatic and suspenseful movie . There are many plots and turns . The story or the director opens question marks on the death row or presumed crimes committed by black people . This film is very well directed by Arne Glimcher and the fine sound of James Newton Howard is excellent . Strong performance of Sean Connery and Ed Harris . If you liked this one don´t miss " TRUE CRIMES " or " THE HURRICANE " . My wife and me gave 8/10 .  
  I first saw a track from this DVD at a hifi show Nov 2006 in London ( i was not really into cream until now ! ) . It was through a high end Arcam system , it sounded great with dts . I had to get this DVD and i 'll tell you this is by far the most exciting music DVD i have ever watched . The performance of Cream at their age was just mind blowing and sound quality is the best i have heard on a music DVD . It does not matter what type of music you like , this one will definitely grow on you . It 's the sheer brilliance of their performance that will make you watch it again and again . Even new musicians don't cut the mustard these days , as these old rockers do .  
  When a small town is threatened by a child killer , a lady police officer goes after him by pretending to be his friend . As she becomes more and more emotionally involved with the murderer her psyche begins to take a beating causing her to lose focus on the job of catching the criminal . Not a film of high voltage excitement , but solid police work and a good depiction of the faulty mind of a psychotic loser .  
  These type of movies about young teenagers struggling with their own sexuality were something unique and daring and daring a couple of years ago but more and more movies like this got made over the past few years , making it hard for the movies to still stand out really . Also this movie received little publicity , aside from the usual little film festivals that featured this little French movie , as well as the big festivals that are always fond of these type of little movies about everyday subjects that aren't being handled too often in movies . The film premiered at Cannes in 2007 and actually won some awards there as well . The movie doesn't really stand out from others , since it actually features little new once you 've already seen some similar movies such as this one but this however really doesn't mean that " Naissance des pieuvres " is a bad one to watch . The movie is certainly a good watch , that handles its subject well and tells its story steadily and therefore also effectively , in a typical somewhat slow French cinematic pace . It 's a coming of age movie , that focus on the life of mainly 3 totally different mid-teenagers . Sexuality is a big theme within the movie , which gets handled delicately and subtle . It makes the movie and its story overall a pretty realistic one , though perhaps a bit predictable , since the movie doesn't quite offer anything original enough within its genre . This type of French movie will probably scare off a lot of people because of the reason that they probably expect it to be very arty , with deep layers and meanings to it . " Naissance des pieuvres " however is a very accessible movie for everyone and you really don't have to be into Euro-teen movies to appreciate this movie . It 's a sweet and somewhat sensual kind of movie , due to its subject and visual approach . The movie is also being made realistic by its actors , who don't had and have a lot of experience within the movie business but are authentic looking and feeling within their roles . The strong individual characters provide the movie with some nice themes and good moments . A good movie on its subject . 7/10  
  Not everything is said in this excellent first feature from Céline Sciamma . The friendship , the " wanting to fit in " , the first sexual feelings .. All this and much more is sublimated through the underwater synchro swimming scenes . All three girls in the movie try to find and express their personality in a very different way . It is a much less violent approach to the understanding of the teenage years compared to , say , " Thirteen " , but a very worthwhile trip nonetheless . A must see , and please leave all American cinematographic preconceptions at he door . The soundtrack is A + by the way . Bon cinéma !  
  If you love cult 70 's Sci-fi the way I do , or if you like movies such as " Repo Man " or " Buckaroo Bonzai " than you 're going to love this one . It 's a stream of consciousness 70 's Sci-fi spectacular , including a 22nd century junkyard and the Earth a million years from now . This movie is pure 70 's . Put on Steve Miller 's " Fly Like An Eagle " or Pink Floyd 's " Dark Side Of The Moon " and you 're ready to go !  
  I 've heard nothing but great things about the 2006 television mini-series , " Planet Earth , " narrated by my childhood idol David Attenborough . Nevertheless , whether it was screened down here in Australia or not , I never caught up with it , and when I happened upon the opportunity to see ' Earth ( 2007 ) '  a feature-length compilation of the same nature footage  on the big screen , I jumped at the chance . The theatre was basically empty ; just one other patron sat in the row ahead of me , and it was as though I had , not only the big screen to myself , but , indeed , the entire planet Earth . For 90 minutes , I was lowered into the beauty and perils of the isolated wilderness , amongst some of the most beautiful living creatures ever captured on film . Awesome in its scope , and yet painfully intimate at times , ' Earth ' is a heartfelt plea from the filmmakers to recognise the delicate balance of life on our planet , and how the intrusion of humans has placed countless glorious animal and plant species on the brink of extinction . Though the film , directed by Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield , obviously argues for the conservation of the wilderness , it refrains from beating us over the head with propaganda , and the puzzle that is politics is ignored altogether ; indeed , there is not a human in sight . Instead , we are simply taken on a breathtaking journey into the majesty of the natural world , to experience the resilience , and also the fragility , of life on Earth . I hear that the original mini-series , which ran for eleven episodes , delves a lot deeper into the scientific background of world ecosystems , but I think that , here , the filmmakers made a wise decision to replace information with emotional impact : I can't remember the last time that I felt so inspired , and yet utterly heartbroken at the same time . By establishing an emotional link between the audience and a select few individual animals , anthropomorphising them to an extent , we are suddenly able to appreciate the " human side " of each species , and their hopeless plight for survival becomes less a statistic and more an unacceptable tragedy . ' Earth ' is basically comprised of a selection of dramatic episodes , whether it be the struggles of a female polar bear to lead her young cubs to the Arctic ice , or the tramp of an elephant herd towards the life-saving seasonal floodwaters of the Okavango Delta . The documentary demonstrates the delicate balance between life and death , most heartbreakingly exhibited in the desperate ballet of predator-prey interactions . Though occasionally , perhaps to cater towards a younger audience , the footage cuts itself short at the crucial moment , I regularly shed at tear at the inevitability of death in nature , and the raw instinct that fuels these animals ' final , hopeless efforts at survival . There 's even a haunting beauty to be found in the hunt , both in the slow-motion footage of a cheetah bringing down its prey { the result of a single fateful misstep } , or the majestic mid-air leap of a Great White Shark as it engulfs a hapless sea lion . It is this frail balance that has been fatally disrupted by the selfishness of our own species . Aside from these main stories , we are also treated to brief snippets of wildlife from around the world , including the birds of paradise of Papua New Guinea , and the autumn migration of the demoiselle cranes . Of course , entire films might have been dedicated to these species alone , and an inevitable consequence of having to sift through so much footage is that some interesting ecosystems are glossed over far took quickly . By choosing to focus most closely on the polar bear , elephant and humpback whale  tracing their lifestyles , via some astonishing high-definition time-lapse photography , throughout a calender year  the filmmakers were able to avoid any structural problems that might arise from having so much to show , and only 90 minutes to show it . Consequently , ' Earth ' left me thirsting for more , and , fortunately , I now have approximately eleven hours more , as soon as I can track down a copy of the DVD box-set for " Planet Earth . " Uplifting and tear-jerking , awe-inspiring and heartrending , ' Earth ' is a truly magnificent documentary experience , and it might just be my favourite film of 2007 .  
  CITY HALL is a somewhat mixed bag . Part vignettes of NYC political life , and part moralizing tale . Al Pacino , a Dukakis-esque Boss with Presidential dreams , gives an oft times sullen or subdued performance . There 's a couple times when he chews the scenery , and in the case of CITY HALL , this is where he shines . John Cusack gives a subdued and generally flawless performance , without going into caricature of a New Orleans dialect , or sliding into melodrama during the films climax . Danny Aiello as a burrough political chief , is also very good . I love showtunes , too . The major problem with CITY HALL , and it is a good movie in many ways , is the general feeling of a lack of momentum . It comes off more like a documentary , than a motion picture . We see the action or follow the story from a detached perspective , and naturally , the viewer doesn't become involved . When the viewer doesn't get involved to a certain degree , they become apathetic towards the characters , and eventually , the plot . This tends to alienate , and what should have been a riveting , detail divulging finale , came off as a " Hmm .. uh .. okay . " They say you " Can't fight city hall , " as the tread worn cliche goes . Yet , it still can't stop you from thinking what might have been , if they had just tightened up the screenplay and pacing of this movie .  
  I 've seen this movie about 6 times now . And each time I view it , I 'm more impressed by the story and the acting . Its like watching a train wreck being set in motion . Its subtle in its approach , but very effective in reaching its goal . Spoilers -> At the center of the story is a very nice dichotomy . On the one hand we have Deputy major , Eddy Calhoun ( Cusack ) unknowingly tearing at the old boys network that forms the hart of major of New York 's Administration and on the other hand we have the mob boss Zappati who 's deliberately trying to maintain the status quo through all means necessary . This situation nicely culminates in the end when Zappati orders Alselmo to make it easy on himself by killing himself and Calhoun ordering Pappas to do the same , politically speaking . The movie also contains some really great one-liners such as ( a personal weakness of mine ) : - You don't sum up a man 's life in one moment - The only thing new in this world is the history you don't know All in all , a great movie that deserves a much higher rating .  
  The stories in this video are very entertaining , and it definately is worth a look ! The first one concerns a young couple harrassed in the woods by two rednecks , with a great , but unexplained twist at the end . The seond is the best of the lot , and it alone , makes this worth watching - A man is attacked by a dog , which he fears to be rabid - He finds shelter in what appears to be a hospital , but he finds out the employees there are not exactly what they appear to be .. Great twist at the end , and this episode alone scores 10/10 ! If the others were up to par with this one , this would get 10/10 ! The third is the weakest of the bunch - A girl meets with some guys and has wild sex ! There appears to be no point to the story until the end , with a good little twist , but it is spoiled by the awful first part ! Never the less , this is a great movie that will not do you wrong at all ! Well worth a rental !  
  If you want to learn something about the Spanish Civil War and about all the political details and intrigues , let me tell you , you 've chosen the wrong film . This is a vision of the war as it happened in Majorca , a small island off the coast of Spain . When a war like this happens in a small island that takes position for the traitor almost at once , there is no war in the open . The soldiers are sent to the front to fight , in the mainland , while another kind of war happens at home , on the small island . There , neighbours tell on other neighbours , sometimes because their political views are contrary to the new regime , but many people are told on because of old family fights , or maybe the silent introvert who has no friends is told on by someone who wants to " earn some points " . And these things don't happen in the open . There were some trials , true , but many other times people would just be woken up in the middle of the night , taken out of their homes to the closest cemetery where they would be killed . And the next morning the bodies would be found , and people would have an idea of what had happened , but nobody would dare to speak or to do anything . We 're not talking about soldiers killing someone they had never seen in their life . We 're talking about people killing their neighbours , and probably saying hello to their widow the next day , and even attending the funeral for the guy they had killed . We 're talking about villages with one or two thousand inhabitants , where everybody knew everybody . I am from that small island and I 've heard the stories my grandparents told me , and I must say that this film upset me , oh yes , it did ; but I also found it remarkably beautiful and moving . The initial violence is not something the director or the writer made up , that 's how things happened during that war . A kid knowing that his mate 's dad is in the fascist squad that killed his dad ? Completely possible . All that happened later on ? Possible too . TB was real too . At that time my island was not the holiday resort it has become . People were poor , illiterate , and worked in small farms . After the war there were times of hardship . So , you won't find a war story in this film , or at least not the kind of war story you expect . There are no battlefields , no soldiers , no political intrigues . This is the meanest kind of war , which happens when the space is limited ( just check the size of the island ) , when neighbours fight with their neighbours , when members of the same family fight each other , and they live in a place where everybody knows everybody . You 'll find a story about the damage that this particular kind of war can cause to people and the story of how they survive that damage , or maybe they don't . I must mention the excellent work done by the writers who adapted the novel and by all the actors , who managed to sound really Majorcan . That was remarkable .  
  THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD is the third in a series of seven Amicus horror anthologies . If THE MONSTER CLUB is included as part of the series , this would make eight movies . Although , that movie is very different from the others . I look upon the Amicus anthologies with great memories as I used to love them when I was in my teens . My feelings for them today are just as strong . I spent many years trying to track down this movie . The synopses of the stories was so appealing that I went as far as paying a substantial amount for it when I eventually found a copy . As great as though the movie is , I did feel a sense of disappointment when I finally saw it . It wasn't quite as good as I was led to believe . Whilst better than its two predecessors , it 's nowhere near as good as its four successors as I shall demonstrate . The linking story sees John Bennett as a police inspector tracking down a missing person who lives in a mysterious old house . His journey begins at the local police station where he learns the stories of previous occupants . The linking story later sees him visiting the estate agent who sold the house . Whilst this linking story seems enticing on paper , it is flat and lifeless in practice and easily the weakest of any Amicus anthology . I couldn't help but get the feeling that John Bennett is a poor man 's version of Donald Pleasance or Ian Hendry . I would much rather have seen one of the two aforementioned actors in his role . We could have even had both here - one as the police inspector and another as the estate agent . They could , and I believe would , have brought this weak element of the movie to life much better . The movie contains four stories , each of which focuses on an inhabitant of the house . The first story sees Denholm Elliott as a writer of crime stories . He is absorbed into an exciting story about a strangler , even going as far as drawing a sketch to aid his writing . Soon after , he begins seeing visions of his own creation . Some excellent direction by Peter Duffell , particularly with the choice of camera angles helps to detract from the restrained script . Elliott 's performance is superb as the tormented writer and he also helps to elevate the story . The story ends with a semi-twist but I couldn't help get the sense of a script which didn't allow it to live up to its potential . The second story sees Peter Cushing move into the house . He is a lonely man who is still pining for a beautiful young woman who once jilted him and who he keeps a picture of . Cushing 's performance really brings this emotionally-moving story to life . He is helped by the director who chooses to include continual focus on Cushing 's loneliness . This is taken further with a great hallucination scene that helps us to see inside Cushing 's mind . Anyway , Cushing sees a figure at a nearby wax museum that looks just like his girl . Naturally his obsession grows but this seemingly romantic story has a disturbing twist at the end . Joss Ackland plays Cushing 's rival but his performance is massively overshadowed by the late great Peter Cushing . The third story and easily the best sees Christopher Lee - my favourite horror actor of all time - move into the house with his daughter . Mr . Lee gives one his perfect ice cold performances here . He shows no love or attention for his daughter at all . He even brings in a school governess to educate her . The governess , played by Nyree Dawn Porter in another of her superb performances , tries to find out what is wrong . Without giving too much away , I can reveal that witchcraft plays a role . Christopher Lee 's presence is truly electrifying in every scene he 's in . Chloe Franks deserves special recognition for her massively underrated performance as the little girl who is easily the creepiest character in the whole movie . The movie is worth seeing even for the sake of seeing just this one story . The final story is played almost entirely for laughs but it certainly does entertain and that 's what matters . Jon Pertwee plays a horror movie actor who moves into the house . He is very dissatisfied at the approach his producers take to movies , seeing everything as cheap and fake , particularly the costumes . So he decides to buy an authentic cloak for his latest vampire role . Geoffrey Bayldon has an excellent cameo as a dealer who sells Pertwee an ancient cloak . When Pertwee puts the cloak on , he starts developing fangs and basically transforming into a vampire . Pertwee 's performance has to be seen to be believed . It truly is hilarious . Ingrid Pitt is also in this story but her talent is wasted in a role that should have been much larger . The linking story finishes with a loose connection to the final story . This is particularly fitting since the inspector was looking for Pertwee and naturally decides to visit the house . The rest you 'll be able to work out for yourself . As weak as the linking story is , it does have a decent if somewhat unintentionally comical ending . I 'm convinced that the blame for the shortcomings in what should have been a truly magnificent movie doesn't lie with Peter Duffell , the director , who really does his best with what he 's got . I think the script was just too restrained and lacking the ambition that can be found in the four later movies . Overall , THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD , despite its flaws is a must-see for fans of the Amicus anthologies , fans of other Amicus movies or fans of portmanteau horror movies . If my summary provides the movie with enough appeal in your eyes , check it out . You 'll enjoy it !  
  I remember seeing this film years ago on , I think , BBC2 . I would very much like to view it again - does anyone know how I can obtain a copy ? As I remember , it was an especially powerful movie , in particular the scene that stands out is of the horses wearing gas masks . Apart from that I really can't recall too much about the story - which is why I want to view it again ! I have trawled the web but am unable to find a copy , which is unusual in my experience - perhaps there is no DVD or VHS of this film on the market . Would appreciate any help anyone can give me on this . Thanks very much in advance for your assistance . Best regards , Albany234 @ googlemail . com  
  I havent seen that movie in 20 or more years but I remember the attack scene with the horses wearing gas-masks vividly , this scene ranks way up there with the best of them including the beach scene on Saving private Ryan , I recommend it strongly .  
  * What I Like About SPOILERS * Teenager Holly Tyler ( Amanda Bynes ) goes to live with older sister Valerie ( Jennie Garth ) to avoid moving to Japan with her father ; but she doesn't know the half of the wacky things that will happen to her from now on , and not only to her , but to her sister , her friends Gary ( Wesley Jonathan ) and Tina ( Alison Munn ) , boyfriend Henry ( Michael McMillian ) , crush Vince ( Nick Zano ) , Valerie 's boyfriend Jeff ( Simon Rex ) , first boss ( then firefighter then husband ) Vic ( Dan Cortese ) , annoying colleague Lauren ( Leslie Grossman ) and second boss Peter ( ? ) If you don't have a funny bone in your body , please skip this ; if you like only veery sophisticated comedy this isn't for you ; if you like a funny , sometimes touching show with two hot chicks who can act in the lead ( and none other than the fabulous ' Mary Cherry ' from Popular - Leslie Grossman - in the main cast ) , then what the hell are you waiting for ? You 're welcome to Casa De Tyler ! What I Like About You ( 2002-2006 ) : 8 .  
  Either or , I love the suspension of any formulaic plot in this movie . I have re-visited it many times and it always holds up . A little too stylized for some but I fancy that any opera lover will love it . Norman Jewison , a fellow Canadian , takes enormous chances with his movies and his casting and it nearly always pays off in movies that are off centre and somehow delicious , as this one is . I have often wondered at the paucity of Cher 's acting roles , whether she has chosen to minimize this part of her life or she does not get enough good roles to chew on . I have found her to be a superb actress who can retreat into a role , as in this particular one or be loud and daring and fierce as in " Mask " . I found the comedic strokes broad at times ( a hair salon called " Cinderella " ) but this was the whole intent of both the writer and director . Nicolas Page plays the angst ridden tenor of opera , all extravagant gestures , at one point demanding a knife so as to slit his own throat . The Brooklyn scenes are magical , this is a Brooklyn under moonlight , romanticized and dramatic , just like opera . All in all a very satisfying film not to everyone 's taste by a long shot , I loved the ending , everyone brought together like a Greek Chorus , every part subtly nuanced and blending with the others , the camera pulling away down the hall , leaving the players talking . 8 out of 10 .  
  It is quite a simple not very active but very charming film . There were moments where I can see why Cher won the Academy Award for Best Actress , but there were other times when I wondered why Glenn Close didn't win for Fatal Attraction . Anyway , Oscar and Golden Globe winning , and BAFTA nominated Cher plays Loretta Castorini , a simple woman with a low pay job who has just been asked by Mr . Johnny Cammareri ( Danny Aiello ) to marry him . He promises her he 'll be back in a month , as his mother is sick , so she mean while needs to get as much of his family to attend the wedding as possible . Only problem is , when she finds Johnny 's one-handless brother Ronny ( Golden Globe nominated Nicolas Cage ) , they start having a relationship , and there love goes on to that moon scene ( where the title comes from ) . Also starring Oscar nominated Vincent Gardenia as Cosmo Castorini , Oscar , BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Olympia Dukakis as Rose Castorini and John Mahoney as Perry . It ends with no wedding for Johnny and Loretta , but she and Ronny were happy together . It won the Oscar for Best Writing , Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen , and it was nominated for Best Director for Norman Jewison ( In the Heat of the Night ) and Best Picture , it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Score for Dick Hyman and Best Original Screenplay , and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy / Musical and Best Screenplay . It was number 96 on 100 Years , 100 Quotes ( " Snap out of it ! " ) , it was number 17 on 100 Years , 100 Passions , and it was number 41 on 100 Years , 100 Laughs . Very good !  
  I 'm normally a sucker for romantic films which are well-filmed and well-acted out . This is a romantic ( period ) film set in 17th-century Italy , but filmed in French with English subtitles . The fact that it is a period film means it will inevitably be slower-paced than films set in the modern day era , so it Will bore some . If you can overlook that fact , it is actually a really good film . The scenery , the costumes , and the cinematography are beautiful , and the main actors and actress are very compelling in their portrayals , projecting the intensity of the emotions that are running through the plot . The story is like a sad love story with an unhappy ending . Its easy to believe that this is an accurate portrayal of the real-life characters . In spite of the fact that I was really moved by the main characters and the storyline , I decided to check out the validity of the story and found out that the main theme of the movie 's story - that of an sad unfinished love story - was completely fabricated . In real life , Artemisia was raped by Tassi initially , rather than submitting to his advances willingly and passionately as the movie had portrayed . She continued to have sexual relations with him only because he had repeatedly promised to marry her . When they were in court , he had * not * admitted guilt of rape out of pity for Artemisia 's torture ( unlike what the movie portrays ) . In reality , he had tried to portray Artemisia as a loose , promiscuous woman with insatiable sexual urges . In the movie , his sister testified in court that Tassi had a wife and had sexual relations with his sister-in-law , and Tassi 's character was all the while made to appear as if his sister had been slandering him regarding his alleged affair with his sister-in-law ( although he admits to having had a wife back in Florence ) . Needless to say , in reality it wasn't really like that at all . In fact , far from it . Tassi was really responsible in the planned murder of his wife , whom he had begotten from rape . And to add to that , Tassi really had sexual relations with his sister-in-law , impregnating her in the process , but all this wasn't really mutual as well - again , he had raped his sister-in-law before . So now we have a clear picture of the real Tassi as a multiple sex offender , what do we make of the film Artemisia 's portrayal of him as a lover ? We take it as an attempt to make this movie into a romantic film .. that this film was never made to be historically accurate .. Apart from these points just mentioned , there were other historical inaccuracies like in its interpretation of Artemisia 's art ( in real-life , she was never really influenced by Tassi 's painting style , and she was actually considered a much better painter than Tassi ever was . ) One thing remains true and its the fact that Artemisia Gentileschi has been credited as the first woman painter in history , and although her mastery of the art rivalled many of her male peers , she had always experienced difficulty in getting enough credit for her work because of her gender as a woman , in 17th century Italy . Enjoy this film for its own sake , for it is a pretty good romantic drama , but take its historical references with a grain of salt .  
  Anyone who does not find this movie funny , does not understand simple comedy . This movie is not a complex comedy , it is full of one liners , and sight gags , and will make anyone who wants to laugh , laugh .. The alien who is doing a Nicholson impression will crack you up !  
  While thinking of " The Great Escape " I allowed my mind to wander back to this little gem of a movie from my childhood . I had read and re-read the autobiographical novel from 1949 which inspired it , and when it came to the only cinema ( we never used that word then , actually ) in town that showed " foreign " films , I was first in line to buy my ticket . As someone brought up on wartime newsreels and propaganda films during WWII , I had an avid interest in exploring the realities of that conflict as reflected in the memoirs and stories of men who were there in person . That extended later to a keen willingness over the years to buy any book on the subject , and eventually to read the equally compelling novels of Hans Helmut Kirst and Erich Maria Remarque , which provided an even deeper sensibility . The movie versions , however , were unlike this one in that they rarely delivered the goods . The medium of black-and-white film has never been served so well as it was in those years . I have never seen any technicolor version of war that seems as authentic as do the deep chiaroscuros of films like " The Wooden Horse . " If it is true that we are destined always to be captive to the images of our childhood , then I confess it freely . And there will never be another the likes of Leo Genn as the emblematic British war hero on film . Not even Sir Alec .  
  Look , this is quite possibly one of the best movies America has to offer the rest of the world . To hate this movie is to hate freedom itself . I remember that the early 80 's were a time of uncertainty . The economy was weak , communism threatened us all , and nuclear destruction was almost a certainty . Out of that confusion came a hero , Stroker Ace . Ned Beatty 's performance in this movie showed he was never again to be type cast as a one dimensional victim in the wilderness . His triumph is an inspiration to all . The on-screen chemistry between Burt and Loni draws obvious comparisons to Brad and Jennifer . Jim Nabors is a poet . Go see this movie tonight !  
  ' The 40 Year Old Virgin'made me laugh a lot . I don't care if it is considered to be a very sexual comedy , I just enjoyed many of the jokes and scenes present in this movie . Steve Carell is perfect as the virgin nerd Andy Stitzer and I think the scene where Andy has his chest hair removed by wax one of the coolest , specially because it is real . Many of the actors and actresses present in this movie are well known or already famous , by the way . Andy Stitzer has a peaceful life . He is a little bit strange and collects lots of toys , but seems harmless . One day , while playing poker with his friends of his work , they discover that Andy is in fact .. virgin ! And he is already 40 years old ! After this surprising revelation , all his friends are trying to make Andy sleep with a woman .. the problem is the confusions in which Andy gets in , specially now that he is really starting to like Trish , a woman he met when she was buying a DVD player in the store he works at .  
  I have watched this movie three times . The last time , I kept skipping around confusing scenes to find resolution for the plot . Perhaps the plot is not intended to hang together logically . Or perhaps these rough spots are in the plot because Ann 's recall of distant events is rather faulty . Take the young Ann Grant ( Claire Danes ) . Here is a young woman who has attended an unnamed college with the scions of a rich family . She must have had help to afford this very expensive education , but never seems to have any family ties at all . She never seems to have any relatives she can turn to when the consequences of one of her disastrous decisions take effect . Ann shares an evening of passion with her great love Harris Arden ( Patrick Wilson ) . Then , when Harris comforts Lila after the tragic death of her brother Buddy , Ann suddenly finds him repulsive and is disgusted with her own behavior . I must have missed something significant here . Ann 's behavior seems totally inexplicable . Ann abandons her relationship with Harris and eventually marries one of the groomsmen at Lila 's wedding . Despite Ann 's rejection of Harris , she continues to hold deep feelings for him on her deathbed . It was obvious from his behavior that Harris was deeply smitten with Ann and would have gladly married her . A scene showing their chance meeting years after Lila 's wedding showed that Harris still had deep feelings for Ann . The film showed a pattern for Ann 's romantic relationships . She always had a falling out with her men and she rejected them . This pattern held with Harris and two husbands . In contrast , Lila married a man she did not love and she remained with her husband until he died . Perhaps Lila was able to build a relationship because she refused to let her marriage fail . Then came the too convenient reappearance of Lila Ross at Ann 's bedside . Apparently Ann 's nurse was able to extract enough information from Ann 's last few lucid moments to identify and contact Lila . None of this communication appeared on the film . I kept wondering about the house Ann was living in during her final days . How did she afford to buy such a house on the meager earnings of her singing career ? Ann always seemed one step ahead of financial disaster while raising her two daughters . On another level , I enjoyed the film 's setting and music immensely . The seaside mansion was just so heartbreakingly beautiful . Claire Danes was luminous as the young Ann Grant . She is really quite a talented singer . I much prefer her natural brunette to the bottle blonde look she had in the film extras . If only those pesky CGI fireflies would go away , I could raise the movie a whole point in my vote !  
  Criticism of the film EVENING , based on the novel by Susan Minot and adapted for the screen by Minot and Michael Cunningham , has been harsh , so harsh that it may have discouraged many viewers from giving the film a try . The primary criticism has centered on the fact that very little happens in this film about a dying woman 's fretting over a mistake she made one summer in her youth , that famous actors were given very minor roles , that the entire production was over-hyped , etc . For this viewer , seeing the film on a DVD in the quiet of the home , a very different reaction occurred . Ann Grant Lord ( Vanessa Redgrave ) is dying in her home by the ocean and her medication and memories allow her to share a man 's name - ' Harris ' - with her two grown daughters Nina ( Toni Colette ) and Constance ( Natasha Richardson ) . As her daughters sit at her bedside Ann relives a particular summer when she was a bridesmaid for her best friend Lila ( Mamie Gummer ) - a marriage both Ann ( Claire Danes as the youthful Ann ) and Lila 's alcoholic brother Buddy ( Hugh Dancy ) objected to , feeling that Lila was simply marrying a man of her class instead of the boy she had loved - Harris Arden ( Patrick Wilson ) , her housekeeper 's son who had become a physician . Harris , Buddy , Lila , and Ann are woven together in a series of infatuations and romances that have been kept secret until now , 50 years later , as Ann is dying . The older Lila ( Meryl Streep ) visits Ann at the end and the secrets are revealed : ' there are no such things as mistakes - life just goes on . ' The film is a delicate mood piece and the script by Minot and Cunningham is rich in atmosphere and subtle life lessons . Yes , there are gaps in the story that could have used more explanation , but in order to maintain the aura of nostalgia of a dying lady 's words , such ' holes ' are understandable . The film is graced by the presence of not only Redgrave , Richardson ( Redgrave 's true daughter ) , Collette , Gummer ( Streep 's true daughter ) , Meryl Streep , Claire Danes , Eileen Atkins , Glenn Close , Hugh Dancy and Patrick Wilson , but also with an ensemble cast of brief but very solid performances . The setting is gorgeous ( cinematography by Gyula Pados ) and the musical score is by the inimitable Jan A.P. Kaczmarek . Lajos Koltai ( " Being Julia ' ) directs . Judge this film on your own .. Grady Harp  
  I had the pleasure of viewing this beautiful film last night , with the wonderful addition of a question and answer session with the director following the viewing . I suspect that the first commenter has never lost a parent or someone very close to them in death . I have had many such losses , and this movie spoke to me . One of the major themes is how we don't deal with questions / issues / stories with our loved ones until it 's too late-they 're too incapacitated or dead before that happens . Talk to your loved ones , listen to and record their stories , tell people you love them , resolve differences . I loved the message that there are no mistakes . I love the director 's portrayal of the relationship of the two daughters-as one of six siblings , it 's clear to me he understood how complex those relationships are . His history as a cinematographer also comes through loud and clear-what a beautiful movie ! The casting is outstanding-a film not to be missed !  
  this movie was rather awful Vipul Shah 's last movie was good this one was just bad although it 's a good story and is handled in a great way Aatish Kapadia who adapted this movie from another gujarati play " Avjo Wahala Fari Malishu " made a good but slow pianful 2 and a half hours to watch there are a lot of flaws in this movie but it 's still a entertainer songs are rather bleaked out and don't work well but they 're still good overall not a movie you would enthusiastically watch it 's still a story to take in to account and it 's good if you 're the relationship type pretty good movie with loads of flaws and humor that 's really not needed even one bit  
  Like his elder brothers , Claude Sautet and Jean-Pierre Melville , Alain Corneau began to cut his teeth in French cinema with a series of fine thrillers : " la Menace " ( 1977 ) and " Série Noire " ( 1979 ) among others . " Police Python 357 " is a good example of how Corneau conceived and shot his works at this time of his career . They had a splendid cinematography , painstaking screenplays and a sophisticated directing elaborated for efficiency 's sake . The police superintendent Ferrot ( Yves Montand ) is a cop with unconventional methods who usually works all alone . He makes the acquaintance of a young woman Sylvia Léopardi ( Stefania Sandrelli ) and becomes her lover while ignoring that she has another lover : his superior Ganay ( François Périer ) . When the latter learns it , he kills her in a fit of anger . Ferrot has to investigate the murder and all the clues are inexorably against him .. One could deem that this kind of far-fetched story isn't exempt from glitches and sometimes , one can see right through it but Corneau 's pedantic directorial style helps to conjure up a stifling , dusky atmosphere . The first part of the film before the night of the murder might seem uninteresting and however , it is crucial for what will follow this key-moment . Corneau falls back on a sober treatment with rather sparse moments and short appearances by secondary , minor characters whom the viewer will see again during the investigation . In spite of drawbacks , Corneau and his scenarist Daniel Boulanger penned a deft story . Ménard ( Mathieu Carrière ) who sometimes expresses his surprise because Ferrot keeps a relatively low profile during the investigation . But his superior knows that he usually works alone . Actually , Ferrot has to find solid tricks to muddy the waters and so to exonerate himself . Eventually , the chief idea of the film concerns Ferrot himself . He 's a cop who bit by bit loses his identity and finds himself in the heart of a terrible depersonalization . It is epitomized by the moment when he throws himself acid on his face so that witnesses won't recognize him when he is brought face to face with them . The backdrop of this thriller , Orléans is efficiently enhanced by Corneau 's camera and helps to inspire this eerie thriller its pernicious charm .  
  Several years ago the Navy kept a studied distance away from the making of " Men of Honor , " a film based on the experiences of the service 's first black master chief diver 's struggle to overcome virulent racism . Ever eager to support films showing our Navy 's best side the U.S.S. Nimitz and two helicopter assault carriers , with supporting shore installations , were provided to complement this engrossing tale of a young sailor 's battle with uncontrollable rage . Some of the movie was shot aboard the U.S.S. Belleau Wood . Antwone Fisher wrote the script for Denzel Washington 's director 's debut in which he stars as a Navy psychiatrist treating Fisher , played effectively and deeply by Derek Luke . Fisher is an obviously bright enlisted man assigned to the U.S.S. Belleau Wood ( LHA-3 ) , a front line helicopter assault platform . Fisher can't seem to avoid launching his own assaults at minimal provocation from his fellow enlisted men . Sent to the M.D. as part of a possible pre-separation proceeding , Fisher slowly opens up to the black psychiatrist , revealing an awful childhood of great neglect and shuddering brutality . The story develops as Fisher cautiously but increasingly trusts his doctor and gets the courage to pursue a love interest , an enlisted sailor named Cheryl , played by a stunningly beautiful Joy Bryant . Fisher reluctantly engages with the doctor by asking long simmering questions but soon realizes he must seek the answers , however painful , in order to grow and move away from conflict-seeking destructive behavior . While all the main characters are black , this story transcends race while unflinchingly showing the evil of exuberant religiosity and concomitant hypocrisy in foster family settings . Viola Davis , a versatile actress seen in a number of recent films , is a picture of sullen immorality but is nothing compared to foster mom , Mrs . Tate ( Novella Nelson ) , who in short but searing scenes would earn - if it existed - the Oscar for gut-churning brutality . Films about patient-therapist interaction follow a certain predictability ( all that transference and counter-transference stuff ) but the earnestness of Fisher and his doctor / mentor is realistically gripping . It 's a good story , well told . Period . While set in the Navy , " Antwone Fisher " is not in any real sense a service story as was " Men of Honor , " an excellent movie that dealt with crushing racism directed against a real person . Nor is it truly a film about blacks . It 's about surviving terrible childhood experiences and , as Fisher says , being able to proclaim in adulthood that the victim is still " standing tall . " The persecutors shrink in size and significance as a brave and strong young man claims his right to a decent life with the aid of a caring doctor . My only quibble is that Washington is a lieutenant commander but is addressed as commander . With all the Navy support people listed in the end credits , someone should have told Director Washington that his character , like all naval officers below the rank of commander , is addressed as " Mister . " Not a big criticism , is it ? : ) I don't know why this film is playing in so few theaters . It deserves wide distribution . Derek Luke may well get an Oscar nomination . 8/10 .  
  ANTWONE FISHER is the story of a young emotionally troubled U.S. Navy seaman . His problems lead him to Jerome Davenport , a psychiatrist who helps him realize that his troubles stem from his childhood upbringing . Get ready to shed a tear or two . The movie could thaw the coldest heart . I loved the story , which turns from something so very awful to happen to anyone into a positive ending . ANTWONE FISHER is a powerful movie , most importantly about forgiveness . Other important issues that get you thinking are child abuse , adoption , and foster care . Oscar winner , Denzel Washington does an impressive job in his directorial debut . There were many scenes which I enjoyed watching . They included the beginning ( dreams of a little boy  check out the gigantic-sized pancakes ! ) and the ending ( dreams turned into reality ) , which beautifully tied the story together . Another wonderful scene occurred when the doctor encouraged Antwone to search for his family to find answers to his questions about his family that abandoned him . My favorite scene happened when the young man finally confronted his mother and her reaction towards him . Priceless . All the actors represented their parts well . In addition to directorial responsibilities , Mr . Washington continues to show why he won an Oscar award and is successful in all his acting roles . He had a strong presence in this movie . Actor , Derek Luke demonstrated why he was so right for the part of Antwone Fisher . He portrayed very real and heart-tugging work . Joy Bryant who played the part of Cheryl , Antwone 's love interest , resembled a ray of sunshine on the screen . The chemistry flowed well between the romantic characters . Novella Nelson who played the part of Mrs . Tate , a despicable character , deserves special mention . Although we only see her for a few minutes , the actress who played Fisher 's mother gave an outstanding performance . Everyone should see ANTWONE FISHER .  
  I just watched Antwone Fisher on BRAVO . What an awesome movie and incredible young man . This movie is a must see for anyone who is dealing with how to overcome childhood abuse and abandonment as an adult . Denzel Washington puts in an outstanding performance as well as the young man who plays Antwone Fisher . Kleenex alert-Feel good and tearful . The most heartrending moment is when he finally meets his mother , who he was taken away from at 2 months of age . And one of the most courageous was when he stood up to his abusive foster mother and sister . I saw this movie on Bravo in 2008 and only wish I had known about it years ago . Definitely a movie to add to my DVD collection .  
  Antwone Fisher 's story of childhood neglect and abuse is an inspiration to all among us who witnessed or even experienced the plight of foster children . Abandoned by a troubled mother , Antwone has never met his father . Growing up with " church going " abusers who use the " n-word " not only to intimidate and hurt but also as a term of endearment , as a young man witnessing how his best friend is killed in a hold-up , enduring racial slurs and being teased while serving in the Navy , Antwone 's anger is slowly turned into positive power when counseled by a Navy psychiatrist , and a love enters his life . The scene where Antwone meets his birth mother is one of the most powerful moments in the film . Stunned by the unexpected confrontation , the woman listens in silence to hear the young man tell her how he has lived a life without crime , addictions to drugs , fathering children left and right , all despite his utterly adverse circumstances . If that scene wasn't powerful enough , the very next one drives it home ( and opens the flood gates ) : A reception to welcome home Antwone ; dozens of smiling faces and open arms announcing that HE is part of this great family . One of the messages delivered by this wonderful film is that there are many well-meaning and sincere people working to help orphans and unwanted children . Even if some of the homes and administrators don't seem to care and appear self-serving , many do give it their all . The character who found Antwone 's " file " once he disclosed the circumstances of his birth is one of those " bright lights " in the darkness of the system . The DVD includes a French Language track , various subtitle choices , as well as additional features and information about foster parenting . As a Clevelander I appreciated the location footage . No matter where you are from , you will be deeply moved by this autobiographical gem .  
  Eight Simple rules started as a very entertaining series . I love John Ritter and his character Paul Hennessey and the relationship he had with his children was the best part of the show . I have always preferred Kerry to Bridget , Bridget has been done before , Kerry is quite unique and i can relate to her in many ways , although i 'm not sure i like the direction her character went in later series . Early episodes were fun , good simple teenage plots about Paul and Cate disciplining the kids , however i think the show lost it 's sparkle when John Ritter died . I admired the cast and crew for wishing to continue the series but when he died , i felt the programme did to . To me the whole point of the show was based around the guide of the ' 8 simple rules of dating my teenage daughter ' it was written by a real man with teenage daughters and the relevance and the angle of the show had changed without the Hennessey dad . Bridget seemed to get more annoying , Rory stayed the same and Cate was always giving her offspring life 's lessons which before seemed funnier when it was all left to Paul . I think the Granddad is funny ( Especially when he 's watching Great escape ) but feel C.J is unnecessary to the show . He is funny in parts but I felt the story lines at the time of his arrival were very similar to other American comedy series . Over all the newer ones aren't bad just missing excitement and does anyone else find it irritating that Cate works at the school and C.J and Granddad 's always there too ? I would always recommend this show to friends as it was very strong at the beginning and well worth watching for Paul and Kerry , but later ones were about average at best .  
  This show is awesome . I thought that the two episodes where Paul died were so sad ; I actually cried . But the other shows were awesome ; Kerry was my favorite character , because she was in " the dark side . " I also thought that Bridget was funny because she was all perky . I also thought that guy who played Kyle was really , really cute . I loved it when Kerry made sarcastic remarks about everything . The guy who played Rory was cute , and Paul , played by John Ritter , was really funny . This whole entire TV show is funny , and I wish they still showed it on TV . when they did show it on TV , though , I watched it every single time it was on . The next time it shows , I will watch it over and over again .  
  This is an excellent film about the characters in a adult swimming class , their problems , relationships and interactions with each other . It should have managed a wider distribution as it 's much better than similar films from major studios out at the same time . The swimming instructor is an almost-Olympian , reduced to teaching adults basic lessons , and often the target of horndogging from his female students . He attempts , more or less , to fend them off , with varying results . The students characters are mainstream U.S.A ; teachers , policemen , college students and retired people , all of whom haven't learned to swim for some reason . The movie covers their relationships , including friends , relatives and romantic conquests as they go through the class . Several subplots provide amusing fodder , including a teacher going through a divorce , some high school students making a documentary , and a girl who is only in the class to meet guys . This is a good date movie , or just one to watch when you 're in the mood for a romantic drama with overtones of reality .  
  Really , I think this movie is more an example of an easy target than a truly bad film . In fact , the movie is done very well in many respects and is very entertaining . Yes , the script is a little convoluted , but that 's the genre . The film has a noirish atmosphere centered around a femme fatale . Just like all the old noir classics , this , too , has a screenplay that twists you around so that you don't always know how to make sense of it at first , and it can be a stretch if you think too deeply and try to put all of the pieces together . That 's the genre . In general , the script has enough surprises and turns to keep the viewer guessing and , in turn , surprised , without abandoning the viewer . Sharon Stone is also an easy target . The truth is she looks great and she speaks her double-entendre laden dialog in such a way as to zhuzh it up into something mysterious , sexy and fun . The direction is more than passable , because let 's face it-you have to keep an audience interested in the " did she or didn't she ? " question for two hours . In addition to a twisty script and a fun performance by Stone , this is done effectively through the direction by the creation of a noirish atmosphere that is both dark and very stark and modern at the same time , with straight industrial lines to go along with Stone 's sexy curves . The frame is always beautiful-press pause anywhere and there is something interesting to the eye . The film also effectively builds on things that were gimmicks in the first film and turns them into something a little more real , particularly the sex . " Katherine Tramell is bisexual .. how shocking ! " becomes treated more matter-of-factly here , and typically , the sexuality of the film is used to better effect . It is still titillating , but not done so readily for shock value and buzz as done in the first . I won't say that it isn't still somewhat of a gimmick because , let 's face it , this film is supposed to be fun . And a fun film it is . It may be an easy target , but if you watch it for what it is : a noirish , femme-fatale driven , twisty , sexy , did she or didn't she who-dunnit , you 're bound to enjoy it ( no pun intended ) .  
  It seems that it is becoming fashionable to rip " Basic Instinct 2 , " to the point that a significant part of the audience ( including critics ) found it terrible even before it was released . It seems even more fashionable to trash Sharon Stone wholike all of usis now fourteen years older , andunlike most of usstill looks wonderful . First comments on this movie were so vicious that I had to see for myself . In my opinion , this sequel is not nearly as good as the original film , but is not as bad as most comments pretend . Michael Caton-Jones is not Paul Verhoeven , neither Henry Bean and Leora Barish are Joe Eszterhas . " Basic Instinct 2 " is just an entertaining , average thriller , and besides the addition of Jerry Goldsmith original score , keeps little resemblance to its predecessor . Even Stone gives her character a different dimension , creating a lustful , devilish Catherine Trimell , who can perfectly well rank among other monsters like Hannibal Lecter . She is an intelligent actress who is not afraid of taking risks and can play with camp at her leisure . Unfortunately , she seems to be the main target for those who enjoy trashing this flick . She became too successful , too much of a main icon , and like all those actors who have reached that level , her time has arrived and she is now bound to be destroyed by Hollywood audiences . The rest of the cast is outstanding , giving performances that are far better than the material deserves . David Morrissey is a much better actor and by far more interesting than Michael Douglas : his acting is flawless , giving a dense , complex dimension to an otherwise one dimensional character . Since he has more screen time and is the axis of the movie , he can keep your attention from beginning to end . I am not recommending " Basic Instinct 2 " as a great movie ; I am just expressing my disagreement with most of the comments on this site and my conviction that agendas other than the movie itself are shaping the opinion of most spectators .  
  This was my favourite film as a child , and I have been in the stage production a few times so it will always remain my favourite muscical and I doubt anybody could ever re-make the story of Oliver Twist on screen , any better than this one did . My all-time favourite ' bad guy ' has to be Oliver Reed as Bill Sikes . Not only did he scare the life out of my when I watched it as a 6 year old , but now as a woman I can empathize more with Nancys character , the bar maid / prostitute who helps Oliver get the life he deserves . Jack Wilde as the artful dodger , was fantastic , and I don't think anybody could ever out-do him , as the street-pocket picker , and best friend of Fagin . The music is fantastic , especially Fagin 's numbers , I 'm also quite thankful they didn't give Bill Sikes a musical number , it wouldn't of worked with him being such a sinister character . I think Carol Reed did an excellent job of Nancy 's sticky ending , keeping it a G rated movie by disguising her beating , but giving enough away to show the violence of Bill towards her . This movie is both charming , and charismatic as a musical sing-along , as well as being a moving drama that follows a young boy as he tries to find where he belongs in life .  
  I took part in a little mini production of this when I was a bout 8 at school and my mum bought the video for me . I 've loved it ever since ! When I was younger , it was the songs and spectacular dance sequences that I enjoyed but since I 've watched it when I got older , I appreciate more the fantastic acting and character portrayal . Oliver Reed and Ron Moody were brilliant . I can't imagine anyone else playing Bill Sykes or Fagin . Shani Wallis ' Nancy if the best character for me . She put up with so much for those boys , I think she 's such a strong character and her final scene when .. Well , you know .. Always makes me cry ! Best musical in my opinion of all time . It 's lasted all this time , it will live on for many more years to come ! 11/10 !  
  If you have never viewed this film and like old time veteran actors , this is the film for you . Seeing Frank Sinatra when he was very young and extremely thin with sunken in cheeks and a wonderful voice which sang some great old songs . Michele Morgan , ( Millie Pico ) gave an outstanding performance with plenty of dance and musical numbers . Leon Errol , ( Cyrus Drake ) gave a great supporting role along with Victor Borge , ( Sir Victor Fitzroy Victor ) who performed classical piano and no slap stick comedy like he did in his career . This is not a great musical , but Frank Sinatra was a great joy to see at the beginning of his career in the 1940 's .  
  Such a masterpiece as the first of these two Snowy River films was , the sequel to The Man From Snowy River is everything that a follow-up should be . It does not tread on the toes of its predecessor , preferring to leave the legend that was the first film live on in some unique immortality . The Man From Snowy River II is based upon the return of Jim Craig to the Snowy River country after a three year absence . The film subtly tells a tale of change in the nineteenth century , of Australian history , legend and horses . The storyline demonstrates a touch of Hollywood in lighter shades , an aspect that was absolutely absent in the first film , yet this blends uniquely with the a distinct sense of Australian patriotism . The plot is far more vibrant than the first film , and much more showy , with particular aspects of the previous incorporated into the film , yet The Man From Snowy River II possesses every essential characteristic of the first film ; sensationally beautiful cinematography , a stunning focus of the Australian high country , the second most impressive footage of horses ever filmed , and a fantastic and deeply moving soundtrack by Bruce Rowland which equals the first in every way . Geoff Burrowes has done a superb job with this film , and it is highly worthy of recognition , especially with regard to the quality of the Australian Film Industry . The lead cast , from Tom Burlinson to Sigrid Thornton , and a well-replaced Brian Dennehy , carry off their parts with as much passion and distinction as the first film . As far as sequels can go , The Man From Snowy River II is a masterpiece ; a deeply moving and inspirational experience yet again .  
  This is a bit long ( 2 hours , 20 minutes ) but it had a a lot of the famous Pearl Buck novel in it . In other words , a lot of ground to cover . It was soap-operish at times but had some visually dramatic moments , too , capped off by a locust attack at the end of the film . That was astounding to view . Considering this film is about 70 years old , the special-effects crew on this film did a spectacular job . Paul Muni and Luise Rainer were award-winning actors in their day and they don't disappoint here , both giving powerful performances . The only problem is credibility as all the Asians are played by Caucasions and some of them , like Walter Connolly , just don't look real . I 'd like to see a re-make of this movie with all-Asian actors , not for PC reasons but to simply make the story look and sound more credible .  
  This , despite not being the original - it began life as a play in Central Europe - has weathered the several incarnations that followed ( MGM 's own remake with period songs In The Good Old Summertime , the Broadway show She Loves Me , even the excellent theatre revival in Paris a couple of years ago ) and remains the definitive version and the one they all have to beat . Several previous commenters have identified the contributing factors that make it so successful and memorable not least being the prevailing fashion in 30s and 40s Hollywood for lavishing attention and detail on ensemble playing rather than just two leads as so often happens today - try , for example , removing Ugarte , Ferrari , Renault etc from Casablanca and yes you 'd still have Rick and Ilsa and Viktor Lazslo but they 'd just be frosting without the rich cake mixture below . Jimmy Stewart and Maggie Sullavan WERE both ideal and irreplaceable leads but how much brighter they shine when their performances are reflected in those of Frank Morgan , Felix Bressart , Joseph Schildkraut and Andy Hardy 's Sara Haden and this is BEFORE we factor in that Lubitsch ' touch ' . Okay , maybe they WERE a tad more naive , innocent even , in that Jurassic Age but how many genuine film lovers , sated with scatology , screwing and in-your-face sex , turn back to those days of Stories , Style , Slickness and Skill and wallow in great movies like this one . By far the best thing about this technological age is not CSI but DVD that can at one and the same time make these classics available to nostalgics and show the Matrix freaks how the big boys used to do it .  
  I think that the movie was kind of weird . In the opening scene , a person is killed for no reason . He doesn't get mentioned again . The special effects could have also be better but i enjoyed watching an older horror movie . It isn't the best example of a classic horror movie but it still was an alright movie . I give it about a 5 out of 10 of the scale .  
  A movie you start watching as a late night cable porn .. It is hot in that department but it has even a lot more .. It has a sense of humor .. some action in and out of the " bed " and it has reasonable acting as well as a story worth watching .. A definite adult only movie but well worth watching ..  
  This one will get reviews all over the map because it doesn't comfortably fit any mold . It 's horror - but not a splatterfest . It 's equal part Suspense as well as Horror - yet without the usual Hollywood screams and jerky camera . The feel of the movie is spare and lean with next to no special effects because I think you should listen and watch the faces of the characters . Forget that Brendan is a graduate of the Buffy universe . That 's a red herring . He IS acting here . ' Camp ' is a misreading of the tone of this story . Adrienne Barbeau is giving a rock solid performance - so she must believe the script has something to say . We all know the sorry excuses where the actors plainly don't care anymore and are just waiting for the director to snap " Cut " and get their paychecks . This is Not the case , here . Forgive the fact that the bodies begin to fall with almost mondo-funny regularity . I don't think the intent was humorous - but to keep you off balance . Think of it less of a Horror ' Movie ' and more of a Horror ' Play ' on a stage - that decrepit whitewashed house . Then you might see it 's really about paranoia , fear , and spiralling madness set in an isolated someplace , USA . And it is twisty . Time travel , Mind Control , secret experiments and Nazi 's who may NOT be dead . . . yet . I say rent it and give it a try if you 're in the mood for something a little cerebral . This would be a good choice for a Saturday Midnight sit down .  
  Not a bad martial arts film . Fight scenes were good . Michel Qissi did a good job directing his first film without Van Damme . Story worked without foul language and too much blood . Screenwriter Jeanette Francessca has a good line to the story that works . IT would be great to see something else from her in the same genre . She likes the art and having strong women promenant . IT was definitely worth watching . I recommend the film to all drama and martial arts lovers .  
  This film reminds me of 42nd Street starring Bebe Daniels and Ruby Keeler . When I watch this film a lot of it reminded me of 42nd Street , especially the character Eloise who 's a temperamental star and she ends up falling and breaks her ankle , like Bebe Daniels did in 42nd Street and another performer gets the part and become a star . This film , like most race films , keeps people watching because of the great entertainment . Race films always showed Black Entertainment as it truly was that was popular in that time era . The Dancing Styles , The Music , Dressing Styles , You 'll Love It . This movie could of been big if it was made in Hollywood , it would of had better scenery , better filming , and more money which would make any movie better . But its worth watching because it is good and Micheaux does good with the little he has . I have to say out of all Micheaux 's films , Swing is the best ! The movie features singers , dancers , actresses , and actors who were popular but forgotten today . Doli Armena , a awesome female trumpet player who can blow the horn so good that you think Gabriel is blowing a horn in the sky . The sexy , hot female dancer Consuela Harris would put Ann Miller and Gyspy Rose Lee to shame . Adding further info .. Popular blues singer of the 20 's and 30 's Cora Green is the focus of the film , she 's Mandy , a good , hard working woman with a no good man who takes her money and spend it on other women . A nosy neighbor played by Amanda Randolph tells Mandy what she seen and heard and Mandy goes down to the club and catches her man with an attractive , curvy woman by the name of Eloise ( played Hazel Diaz , a Hot-Cha entertainer in the 30 's ) and a fight breaks out . Then Mandy goes to Harlem where she reunites with a somewhat guardian angel Lena played by one of the most beautiful women in movies Dorothy Van Engle . Lena provides Mandy with a home , a job , and helps her become a star when temperamental Cora Smith ( played by Hazel , I guess she 's playing two parts or maybe she changed her stage name ) tries to ruin the show with her bad behavior . When Cora gets drunk and breaks her leg , Lena convinces everyone that Mandy is right for the job and Lena is right and a star is born in Mandy . Tall , long , lanky , but handsome Carman Newsome is the cool aspiring producer who Lena looks out for as well . Pretty boy Larry Seymour plays the no good man but after Lena threatens him , he might shape up . There are a few highlights but the one that sticks out to me is the part where Cora Smith ( Hazel Diaz ) struts in late for rehearsal and goes off on everyone and then her man comes in and punches her in the jaw but that 's not enough , she almost gets into a fight with Mandy again . In between there 's great entertainment by chorus girls , tap dancers , shake dancers , swing music , and blues singing . There 's even white people watching the entertainment , I wonder where Micheaux found them , there 's even a scene where there 's blacks and whites sitting together at the club , Micheaux frequently integrated blacks and whites in his films , he should be commended for such a bold move . This movie was the first race film I really enjoyed and it helped introduced me to Oscar Micheaux . This movie is one of the best of the race film genre , its a behind the scenes story about the ups and downs of show business . No these early race films may not be the best , can't be compared with Hallelujah , Green Pastures , Stormy Weather , Cabin In The Sky , Carmen Jones , or any other Hollywood films but their great to watch because their early signs of black film-making and plus these films provide a glimpse into black life and black entertainment through a black person 's eyes . These films gave blacks a chance to play people from all walks of life , be beautiful , classy , and elegant , and not just be stereotypes or how whites felt blacks should be portrayed like in Hollywood . Most of the actors and actresses of these race films weren't the best , but they were the only ones that could be afforded at the time , Micheaux and Spencer Williams couldn't afford Nina Mae McKinney , Josephine Baker , Ethel Waters , Fredi Washington , Paul Robeson , Rex Ingram , and more of the bigger stars , so Micheaux and other black and white race film-makers would use nightclub performers in their movies , some were good , some weren't great actors and actresses , but I think Micheaux and others knew most weren't good actors and actresses but they were used more as apart of an experiment than for true talent , they just wanted their stories told , and in return many black performers got to perform their true talents in the films . For some true actors / actresses race films were the only type of films they could get work , especially if they didn't want to play Hollywood stereotypes , so I think you 'll be able to spot the true actors / actresses from the nightclub performers . These race films are very historic , they could have been lost forever , many are lost , maybe race films aren't the greatest example of cinema but even Hollywood films didn't start out great in the beginning . I think if the race film genre continued , it would have better . If your looking for great acting , most race films aren't the ones , but if your looking for a real example of black entertainment and how blacks should have been portrayed in films , than watch race films . There are some entertaining race films with a good acting cast , Moon Over Harlem , Body and Soul , Paradise In Harlem , Keep Punching , Sunday Sinners , Dark Manhattan , Broken Strings , Boy ! What A Girl , Mystery In Swing , Miracle In Harlem , and Sepia Cinderella , that not only has good entertainment but good acting .  
  I checked this out as an impulse when browsing through the movie store and couldn't have been any more pleasantly surprised ! My mom and I watched this film together , and we thoroughly enjoyed it . It isn't the typical " chick-flick " with a sappy love story and tears all the way through , but it definitely touches a nerve in the twist at the end . It 's an ending where , although unexpected and tragic , the movie 's overall effect is not harmed by it . I think Reese Witherspoon was a great actress even in this film , her debut , and this is definitely worth watching ! I didn't recognize many of the supporting actors , but they all play their important supporting roles well . " The Man in the Moon " is such an believable story about a young teenager falling in love for the first time . Most women can definitely relate to everything-from Witherspoon 's words , her subtle glances , and her not so subtle emotions ( raging like the typical teenage girl ) . While she 's playing a character confused about love , she does not come across as silly and immature , which was much appreciated considering many movies today .  
  It was life-changing , IT REALLY WAS ! The Man In The Moon is a breathtaking experience to watch . The acting was fabulous , the story line was great , and this was a perfect start for Reese Witherspoon 's career . I don't see how anyone couldn't love this film . Sure , it 's not the best movie ever , even though it was close to it , but it was highly amusing to watch , and I even had a big laugh at one of the jokes , and a lot of other little laughs . Of course , there was some cry your heart out moments too , but this movie was enlightening , and it brightens up your day , although you have to get a little depressed from the story every now and then . I can't believe this movie didn't win at least one award , and I also can't believe that it 's been seen by so little people on this site . See this movie if you haven't for it is definitely touching .  
  I watched this movie by chance , get curious by the trailer on TV . I like when I discover movies like this , little , tender stories about ordinary people . Even if the end is tragic , " The Man in the Moon " has some funny moments , especially in the first characterization of Dani , with her innocent and pure love affair with Court . It 's really a beautiful , moving love story with 3 high points : the performance of Reese Witherspoon , who maintained her promises in the world of cinema , the beautiful cinematography by the " Old Lion " Freddie Francis and the fantastic score by James Newton Howard , which is really the soul of the movie . His themes ( which deserved an Oscar nomination ) are so intimate and lyric that it seems they had transformed the screenplay in music .  
  It 's a generic coming-of-age story - think " The Member of the Wedding , " " Summer of ' 42 , " " A Summer Place , " even " Little Women " - and there are moments where Mulligan might have omitted the soupy music , not used slow-motion , or played down the golden-lit prettiness of the setting . Otherwise , it 's done with rare emotional perfect-pitch . Nothing 's forced , every line has feeling , and the pacing is just right . Even the below-A-list casting helps : Bigger movie stars with more recognizable personalities might have overwhelmed the material . In particular , Witherspoon is excellent : Her line readings are fresh and original , and her body language is just right for a gawky , hoydenish 14-year-old on the eve of womanhood . Waterston is also very fine , even if he has to spend much of the movie climbing in and out of the family truck . One senses that the film 's makers were aware of its unpromising commercial prospects - no big stars , no big car crashes , no special effects - and consciously decided to make the best possible movie , box office be damned . It 's intimate and honest , and it sticks to the ribs . If you find yourself misting up at the end , you don't have to feel you 've been duped .  
  At first I was weirded out that a TV show 's main character could bring the dead back to life , but then I thought I 'd give it a shot . Guess what ? I love " Pushing Daisies " and look forward to Wednesday nights just to watch it , then for the next week I watch it a few more times on my DVR . The colorful characters , witty banter , fast-paced dialogue , and new unique situations draws me in and captivates from beginning to end . Ned and Chuck Charles ' relationship is interesting to watch as they work their romance around the fact that they cannot have physical contact . Even Detective Emerson Cod 's character has continued to grow in complexity . And Olive Snook ! Jiminy Crispies ! She cracks me up ! The narrator 's voice is fun to listen to and the cinematography gives me the impression that I am watching a movie instead of a TV show . I have recommended my family and friends to turn on " Pushing Daisies " and they are hooked too ! The show is well worth waiting a week for a new episode and if you have not seen " P.D. " , I highly recommend watching it !  
  I didn't mind all the walking . People really did walk places back then . It loaned an air of authenticity to this period piece and some perspective on the technology of the Martians . I too was disappointed by the effects , in particular the " Thunderchild " scene , which I regard as one of the most exciting in the book . But I can't praise this film enough , for its faithfulness to Wells 's story ! It 's about time . The actors are likable and the performances are charming . Also this film is very much worth seeing just to hear Jamie Hall 's truly great musical score . It was interesting to see the same actor play both the writer and his brother in London .  
  " The Classic War of the Worlds " by Timothy Hines is a very entertaining film that obviously goes to great effort and lengths to faithfully recreate H . G . Wells ' classic book . Mr . Hines succeeds in doing so . I , and those who watched his film with me , appreciated the fact that it was not the standard , predictable Hollywood fare that comes out every year , e . g . the Spielberg version with Tom Cruise that had only the slightest resemblance to the book . Obviously , everyone looks for different things in a movie . Those who envision themselves as amateur " critics " look only to criticize everything they can . Others rate a movie on more important bases , like being entertained , which is why most people never agree with the " critics " . We enjoyed the effort Mr . Hines put into being faithful to H.G. Wells ' classic novel , and we found it to be very entertaining . This made it easy to overlook what the " critics " perceive to be its shortcomings .  
  ( Sorry for my faulty language , i am no native speaker .. ) Yes , this is a movie that almost demands an overwhelming reaction . Personally i agree upon all those superlatives that are around . But i won't use this rather sematically void way myself to describe the movie here . Because those " perfect ! the one-and-only ! best-ever ! " - reviews make some people turn away ( including me ) . So if you are looking for another ' Hamlet ' that has the potential to rival with many theatrical and all cinematic ones - Then don't miss this one , if you happen to find it anywhere . ( Unfortunately not too many people will have any chance to see it . It seems there is no DVD out there , and the German language version - which is quite well done - is not available in any format . ) Just in case you decide to get a copy : Spare out that cut down two hours ( or so ) version of this movie . It is no use and no fun , and gives a wrong impression of a movie , that deals in an interesting way with flow and architecture . And its also crippled down to 4:3 aspect ratio . Greetings from Germany , F.L.  
  It 's hard to say anything about a movie like this because there isn't enough words to give this magnificent , stylish and unique film the veneration it unquestionably deserves . They should make this the official and only true real Hamlet - movie because all the previous films out of the same immortal spectacle are being overshadowed by Kenneth Branagh 's " Hamlet " . It 's a perfect , complete version of the play , potent , massive , earthshaking first-class masterpiece Shakespeare would have been proud of . They 've packed over a dozen of world-famous top actors in the same film and everyone of them is having one of the greatest performances of their career . Every moving and charming sequence leaves behind a comprehensive sense of satisfaction . The cameras embrace gracefully the enchanting coulisses . Branagh is phenomenal in the leading role . His sharp , irresistible performance is the only one of it 's kind and will be permanently part of the glorious movie history . Every second in this presentation is feast for the movie lover from beginning to the very end . Branagh 's version of " Hamlet " is among the ten best motion pictures ever .  
  Hugh ( Ed Harris ) is a hotshot , bachelor senator determined to run for president . One day , however , he happens upon an old high school classmate named Aggie . Aggie ( Diane Keaton ) is an accomplished and award-winning author with a lovely face and an independent spirit . Hugh is smitten . He convinces Aggie to become his fiancé . But , will Aggie have to sacrifice her principles of honesty in the world of politics , where things are not always what they seem to be ? And , will she be able to withstand the rigors of a harsh media blitz ? This is , mostly , a nice romance for those who adore tales of affection . Hugh and Aggie are absolutely in love and their banter and conversation are a good view . However , although the movie tries to show the political life in its reality , it doesn't completely succeed . Nevermind . The production values are high and the script is very elegantly written . With these advantages and the handsome personages of Keaton and Harris , those who sit down to the film will find it to be good entertainment .  
  Moonchild is a very difficult movie to categorise . It 's easiest to think of it as several snapshots of the lives of the two central characters . The fact that these characters are members of a street gang set in an multicultural city of the near future and that one of them is a vampire does not preclude them from having moments like any other people , and this is one of the places where this movie is different to anything else I 've ever heard of . It doesn't get wrapped up in the fact that one of the main characters is a vampire , it 's just something that has to be dealt with like any other problem . The way the characters interact is surprisingly realistic - there are embarrassing relatives and tricks that are meant to look cool that just don't work , which leaves the film with a lovely sense of not taking itself too seriously for the most part . The other area that really stood out to me is the languages . The fictional city of Mallepa contains various cultural groups , and characters speak the language that they would be expected to speak . Japanese gang members speak Japanese to each other , but Chinese when talking to characters of Chinese descent . Possibly the most amusing exchange involves an Australian and is conducted in English . The actors of the four arguably main characters have three separate mother tongues between them and speak varying levels of each others ' languages , so it 's quite a feat that the movie was made at all . Which , I suppose , brings me to the lead actors . Much has been made of the fact that the movie stars two of Japan 's biggest rockstars , Gackt and Hyde , as well as Taiwanese superstar Lee-hom Wang , whether it is to praise them for their acting or criticise it or simply fangirl about them . In my opinion , Lee-hom is the best at playing a straight and realistic character . However , any lack of acting ability on Gackt 's part is mostly masked by the fact that the character he plays is prone to being over-dramatic . I wasn't sure if Hyde 's character was supposed to be as sulky and sarcastic as he came across , but it doesn't really detract from the movie either way . There are several scenes which take rather melodramatic turns , which made it difficult for them to affect me much emotionally ( Although this doesn't seem to stop a lot of people ) . I found it 's best to just enjoy the movie for what it is and not take it too seriously - It 's perfect for getting out and watching with a group of friends . It does have its flaws , but overall it was very enjoyable and I 'd highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a few subtitles .  
  Those who know who know the Kelly " legend " & are hoping that this film would be an accurate depiction of his life may be disappointed with the creative license taken with this film ( eg . Naomi Watt 's character never existed in reality ) , but if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment , it holds up pretty well . Ledgers performance in the title role is quite solid , taking the mantle of cinema 's best Ned ( not hard considering the previous Ned 's include Yahoo Serious , Mick Jagger & former Carlton champion ( Australian Rules Football ) Bob Chitty , a great footballer but a poor actor . Some location shooting film in the area I live , Bacchus Marsh outside Melbourne as well as Clunes & Ballarat .  
  In the aftermath of Watergate , a number of conspiracy movies appeared , such as this one , written by the late Adam Kennedy ( based on his novel ) . Gene Hackman plays ex-Vietnam veteran ' Roy Tucker ' , a loser who has wound up in prison . He receives visits from Marvin Tagge ( Richard Widmark ) , who claims to represent an organisation designed to assist the wrongly convicted . They offer him freedom , and despite distrusting Tagge he accepts . But he brings along a fellow cell mate by the name of Spiventa ( Mickey Rooney ) . Exactly why is hard to see , as Spiventa is an irritating little man who drives Tucker mad with persistent talk of sex , not what you want to hear when you are behind bars . Tagge 's benefactors kill Spiventa before Tucker 's astonished eyes . Reunited with wife Ellie ( Candice Bergen ) , and given a new identity ( strangely , he does not attempt to change his appearance . Shaving off that cheesy moustache would have been a start ) , he settles down , but finds there is a catch - Tagge wants Tucker to do no less than assassinate the President of the United States . He refuses , so Tagge has Ellie abducted .. I will leave the synopsis here , but I am sure you can guess the rest for yourself . The script has enough plot holes to make you want to read the book ( neat trick that ! ) . The people Tagge represents are never revealed . The allusions to J.F.K. 's killing are unmistakable . Despite the findings of The Warren Commission , the doubt as to whether Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone persists to this day . This was Stanley Kramer 's first movie in years , and while no turkey , it lacks the grip of say John Frankenheimer 's ' The Manchurian Candidate ' or Alan J.Pakula 's ' The Parallax View ' . Being a left-wing conspiracy movie , it tends to skirt around its subject matter instead of getting to grips with it . I prefer right-wing ones myself - they are funnier ! ' Domino ' has the look and feel of a made-for-T.V. movie , and boasts what must be the easiest prison escape in movie history not to mention an ending copped from the Michael Caine classic ' Get Carter ' . What makes it watchable are Gene Hackman and Richard Widmark . The latter , who sadly passed away earlier this year , is superb as the mysterious Tagge , who initially appears to be behind the operation until he too is ruthlessly eliminated , beginning a chain of deaths designed to remove all trace of evidence as one by one the perpetrators of this evil plot fall - just like dominoes . As Tucker , the innocent pawn , Hackman is marvellous . You have to wonder though why he chose to hide out in such an obvious place . In his shoes , I 'd have fled to the other side of the world , anywhere to get away from these fanatics . Hackman 's love scenes with Bergen slow the plot down , and it is almost a relief when she gets snatched . Presumably the producers thought so too , which explains why it opens with a bizarre prologue setting out the film 's entire premise - voiced by British actor Patrick Allen - warning the audience that ' they ' are out there , and that ' they ' are out to get us . Comedian Les Dawson later spoofed this opening in his B.B.C. show ' The Dawson Watch ' . Mickey Rooney had earlier worked with Kramer on ' Its A Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World ' . His ' death ' scene here resembles like an outtake from that picture , with the actor looking as though he has been stung by a wasp rather than shot dead . Conspiracy movies used to be only made by the left , but now the right are getting in on the act too . Last year , ' Taking Liberties ' , an absurd concoction of lies and half-truths about Tony Blair 's Government turned out to be Britain 's answer to ' Reefer Madness ' . At least , ' Domino ' had lovely Candice Bergen . The best Chris Atkins ' film could offer was Anne Widdecombe ! Surprisingly , ' The Domino Principle ' was made by Sir Lew Grade , the legendary British television mogul behind ' The Saint ' , ' Jesus Of Nazareth ' and ' The Muppet Show ' . He worked with Adam Kennedy again in 1980 on ' Raise The Titanic ! ' , whose failure was so great it sank Grade 's ambitions of being the new Louis B.Meyer . Being somewhat open-minded , I would not rule out the possibility of a conspiracy .  
  Possible SPOILERS : Not Sure While watching The Lion King 1 1/2 , I couldn't help but have mixed feelings about the whole film . It is definitely a good way to spend about an hour and 15 minutes . But there is nothing about it that would give you the same sort of feeling that The Lion King did . The story , for those who haven't read the other reviews , is about how Timon and Pumbaa meet , and how they affect events in the original Lion King . There are actually some very funny jokes in the movie . My favorite part is when they show the pair raising Simba . However , for me the worst parts have to be when they show Timon and Pumbaa directly interfering with the events of the original . I can never look at the " Circle of Life " or " Can You Feel the Love Tonight " sequences the same way again ( I 'm okay with the " I Just Can't Wait to be King " sequence ) . The voice talents are excellent . Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella do a wonderful job , as do Matthew Broderick , the guy who does Rafiki , and the hyenas . Even the actor who does young Simba sounded enough like Jonathon Taylor Thomas for me . But why did they even include a voice actor for Zazu ? He literally had only 2 lines , and neither were very necessary . The additions of Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller only add to the talent , although you still can't hear Timon 's Mom 's voice and not think of Marge Simpson . There are some scenes that seem to not fit in with the original , the one coming to mind being when they are pride rock at the end . How did they have time to fit in the initial fight with the hyenas ? As for the DVD itself , you can't help but feel that for a 2 disc set , the special features are especially lacking . They could have easily fit a commentary , or another aspect ratio on the 1st disc . I enjoyed the " Who Wants to be King of the Jungle " game , even if it is the most shameful example of cross promotion I 've ever seen . Some of the questions are actually difficult . Overall , a good movie , though not nearly as good as TLK or even TLK2 .  
  Everyone , my name may sound weird , but there was nothing else ! Any way , I haven't seen anything like this before so it was crazy ! Of course that 's a good thing . It is a humorously interesting movie and my absolute all time favourite thing is how they intertwine other things into one ! Like chicken little , the fish pretending to be King Kong and Runt the pig saying , " Twas beauty who killed the beast " , War of the worlds scene and more . Walt Disney company has NOT lost his touch maybe not for this one . Also , how they made it like they were watching a movie and it was like a home cinema . However some parts don't fit . Like in the original lion king , weren't Timon and Pumbaa with Simba when he beat Scar ? In this movie , they are not ! they were fighting the hyenas backstage . Ther 's more , the reason being why Pumbaa isn't so confident is because he was pushed away by the other animals and also , it 's just Timon , Timon , Timon . Anybody realise that only Timonn 's story was told , whereas pumbaa only had flashbacks ? But apart from that , IT " S GREAT !  
  This movie can be interpreted on many different levels . Don't listen to the other comments bashing the movie and saying that it is a played again story or w / e and that it is just about drugs . It has very overt superficial metaphors about drugs ; however , the rest of the movie ( and why I think it was personally made ) is really not about that at all . It is really mocking psychology and the conditioning of society . It shows , for a split second , that the main character 's brother is watching those sick videos online . Why ? My interpretation is that it is to demonstrate that all of this gruesomeness that we are exposed to makes it easier for us to be mechanical in our professions instead of seeing people as people . As far as the scene about logic , it is also reaching out to the people who were in the federally mandated 1 % smart classes who are confused and frustrated because life isn't as predictable and mathematical and logical as it seems on a macroscopic level . You have to apply Heisenberg 's uncertainty principle ( along with all the other laws and principles of uncertainty ) not just to physics but to life and leave room to change your plans and adjust along the way . One of the best movies I have ever seen . It just might go way above your head ; it isn't for you it is for those people who are are having trouble coping with life not working out like a math problem . When you are critically analyzing a movie or writing your critical review 's try not reading the back cover first ( written by marketers and parapsychologists )  
  Walking with Cavemen , hosted by Alec Baldwin , is a look back at all the hominid ( that 's us ! ) species of the past 5 million years : who they were , what they were like , and how they died out . Along with being a very interesting scientific look at the information we have on these species , Walking with Cavemen also examines what it is that makes us human . I waited several weeks to watch this , and I was not disappointed .  
  Probably Bigas Luna 's finest achievement for it achieves a delicate balance between sleaze , eroticism and surrealism . The delicious Mathilda May , who spent most of Tobe Hooper 's " Lifeforce " in the buff , is the object of young Biel Duran 's pre-teen lust . He can't get May 's breasts out of his mind and wants so badly to suckle them and suckle the breasts of his own mother , too . His pursuit of May IS the film . As in Luna works such as " Lulu " and " Jamon ! Jamon ! " , the director brings a slightly warped sexual sensibility to his strange but beautiful tale . The usual suspects will be offended , but those with open minds will enjoy this frothy erotic poem to the female breast . José Luis Alcaine 's images are gorgeous and Nicola Piovani 's score is sweet and rich . A gorgeous cinematic confection with a delightfully anarchic sensibility that the Spanish do so naturally .  
  What keeps us going - or at least what I feel the writer wanted us to keep us glued at an early point is our desire to know whether Martinaud has done the dirty deed . Without spoiling so much , of course there is a red herring and a twist . But then we discover that this is the story of Martinaud 's imperfections and his difficulty in coping . When there is the revelation - we begin to sympathize and pity him because as the story progresses we are made to think he is the sick , perverted pedophiliac that we 're predisposed to have in mind . One of those things he has to cope with is the distant gap he and his wife have even though they live on the same roof . These problems of course are given their denouement in the film 's shocking finale . This movie demands your patience and it has certainly tried those of restless teenagers sitting at the rear . They were heckling obviously because they aren't partial to " central location " films . Although there is a bit of travelling , when we get to the woods and the beach . And we realize that Gallien isn't as clever as we are made to think he is . The Inquisitor is 5/5  
  Remarkable , disturbing film about the true-life , senseless , brutal murder of a small-town family , along with the aftermath , and examination of the lives of the killers , Dick Hickok and Perry Smith . No matter how much time goes by , or how dated this film may look , it still resonates the utter incomprehensibility of criminal acts such as this . This really traces multiple tragedies : The tragedy , brutality and senselessness of the murder of the Clutter family , a decent farm family in small-town Holcomb , Kansas ; and the wasted , brutal and sad lives of Hickok and Smith . An interesting point is made in the film : that neither of these two immature , scared , petty criminals would have ever contemplated going through with something like this alone . But , together , they created a dangerous , murderous collective personality ; one that fed the needs and pathology of each of them . They push each other along a road of " proving " something to each other . That they were man enough to do it , to carry it out ; neither wants to be seen as too cowardly to complete their big " score " ; an unfortunate and dangerous residue of the desolate lives they led . These were two grown-up children , who live in a criminal 's world of not backing down from dares ; who constantly need to prove manhood and toughness . in this instance , these needs carried right through to the murder of the Clutters . The film contains a somewhat sentimentalized look at the Clutter family , but the point is made . These were respected , law-abiding , small-town people , who didn't deserve this terrifying fate . The movie also gives us a sense of the young lives of Hickok and Smith . Perry Smith , whose early life was filled with security and love , but watched in horror as alcohol took his family down a tragic path . Hickok , poor and left pretty much to his own devices , not able to see how he fit in , using his intelligence and charm to con everyone he came into contact with . An interesting , and maybe the first , look at capital punishment , and what ends we hope to achieve . Is this nothing more than revenge killing for a murder that rocked a nation at a time when we had not yet had to fully face that there might be such predators among us , or does putting these guys at the end of a rope truly provide a deterent to the childish and brutal posturing of men like these ? Is it possible to deter men who live lives of deceit , operating under the radar , believing they fool everyone they come into contact with ? To be deterred , you must believe it 's possible you will be caught . Is it possible to deter these men who believe they are too clever to be caught ? ; who have committed hundreds of petty crimes , and got away with them ? This was supposed to be a " cinch " , " no witnesses " . When caught , Hickok finds he can't charm and con the agents the way he had department store clerks . Smith , who believes he deserves such a fate anyway , who seemed to be the only one who truly grasped the gravity of what they had done , willingly tells the story when he learns that Hickok has cowardly caved in . Hickok blinked first . A silly game of chicken between two immature , emotionally damaged , dangerous men . Fascinating psychological thriller , telling a story of a horrendous crime in this nation 's history . Stunning portrayals by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson . These roles made their careers .  
  For anyone with a moderate sensibility , a moderate feeling of the human and humane condition , for anyone capable of getting above the Hollywood ilk , for anyone who is satisfied seeing cinema which does not have a series of Seagals / Willis / Van Dammes blasting the brains out of anybody or seeing who gets into bed with whom , for anyone whose intellectual level reaches a capacity to grasp , sympathise with , comprehend , laugh WITH , cry WITH natural tender heart-warming hilarious compassionate HUMAN BEINGS , ` Le Huitième Jour ' is waiting for you . Jaco van Dormael has not achieved simply a masterpiece , that would have been too simplistic ; he has achieved one of those rare monumental works of art in the cinematographic world which defies any kind of encapsuling . Is it a drama ? Is it a comedy ? No : it is the story of Georges , a wonderful funny pitiful laughable loving frightened beautiful personality , a sufferer of the Downes Syndrome . It is a story which has you laughing through your tears , but this is not one of those classic tear-jerkers ; this film moves through a world that has you at once mixing your feelings of compassion or pity or even shame with those of admiration , warmth and even love . A successful banking salesman , Harry , bumps into Georges : they were both going in opposite directions with absolutely opposing ideas , problems and priorities ; skillfully van Dormael melts these two unlikely men into a warm friendship , but which is so much more than the good buddy friendship of those having a beer down the road . This is a relationship which develops into a profound needing by both for the other . The cuasi-surrealist scenes fit in perfectly : Georges recalls ( or invents ) past scenes of his life while either day-dreaming or sleeping ; even the almost phantasmagorical final scene is totally correct . The only scene which might be considered a little out of place is when they steal a bus and drive it out of the show-rooms . However , this does not detract from the whole . This film is a monument . Even if your French is not up to much , please bear seeing it with sub-titles . ` Le Huitième Jour ' is worth the trouble . As for anything else , well , just read the following commentaries  I go along with all of them . This film is a joy , it is majestic , it is unique . If you have seen ` Rain Man ' which I consider an excellent film , you must see this one : it is far superior because it has not the superficial veneer of famous Hollywood-produced world-renowned actors ; it has Pascal Duquenne and Daniel Auteuil  TEN oscars for these two , and three more for Jaco van Dormael . Who cares ? Yes : 11 out of 10 if the IMDb rating doesn't break down under the strain . Magnifique ! Chapeau !  
  Emilio Miraglio 's " The Red Queen Kills Seven Times " ( 1972 ) is just about the most perfect example of a giallo that I have ever seen , mixing all the requisite elements into one sinister stew indeed . First of all , and of paramount importance for me , it has a complex , twisty plot that ultimately makes perfect sense , and the killer here does not come completely out of left field at the end . The story , concerning a series of gruesome murders ( you already know how many from the film 's title , right ? ) that takes place in seeming fulfillment of an ancient prophecy concerning two sisters , is an involving one , and the murderer , a red-cloaked figure with the insane laugh of a madwoman , is both frightening and memorable . Every great giallo requires some lovely lead actresses , and here we have quite an assortment , headed by the ridiculously beautiful Barbara Bouchet as one of the two sisters and , in one of her earlier roles , Sybil Danning , as a lustful tramp at Barbara 's fashion house . Another necessary ingredient of a superior giallo is a catchy , hummable score , and Bruno Nicolai provides one for this film that should stay with you for days . Gorgeous scenery ? Check again . Filmed largely in Wurzburg , Germany , the picture is a treat for the eye indeed . OK , OK , but what about those murders ? After all , isn't that what gialli are all about ? Well , I 'm pleased to report that most viewers should be well satisfied with the various knifings , shootings , impalements and other carnage that this film tastefully dishes out .. not to mention the crypts , freaky dream sequence , rats and bats ( and LOTS of ' em , too ! ) , the drug references , a rape scene , the obligatory red herrings and , in the person of Ugo Pagliai , a hunky leading man for the female viewers . As I said , a perfect giallo . And even better , this DVD is from the fine folks at No Shame , and you know what that means : a gorgeous print and loads of extras , to boot ! Thanks , guys !  
  This is probably one of the worst movies ever made . It 's .. terrible . But it 's so good ! It 's probably best if you don't watch it expecting a gripping plot and something fantastically clever and entertaining , because you 're going to be disappointed . However , if you want to watch it so you can see 50 million vases and Goro 's fantastic hair / bad English , you 're in for a real treat . The harder you think about the film , the worse it gets , unless you 're having a competition to spot the most plot holes / screw ups , in which case you 've got hours of entertainment ahead . I 'd only really recommend this film for the bored or the die-hard Smap fans . And even then , the latter should be a bit careful , because Goro 's Japanese fans were a bit upset about it , they thought he was selling himself out . ( He wasn't really , not when Johnny Kitagawa ( who was the executive producer ) can do that for him ) .  
  When I was born , this television series was the number one show on T.V. ! America epitomized the feat of the ultimate fatted calf country with big ambitions , limitless potential , and a very comfortable economy ! After a big Sunday dinner , why not sit back and watch " Bonanza " , IN COLOR ! This homey western evokes an American tradition which accompanies the complacency of the typical U.S. household during the era in which it was viewed .. The breathtaking cinematography of Lake Tahoe symbolized an infinite prosperity of the emerging American culture ! Western Movies were so popular that Western Television Shows followed suit ! This was a period in time in our country which yearned for a concise reflection on our own country 's struggle for survival ! The end result of the trials and tribulations at the Ponderosa Ranch , as demonstrated in this series , sparked a realization that Americans are now auspiciously enjoying the fruits of the Cartwright 's painstaking labor ! The T.V. Show " Bonanza " was popular for so many different reasons , mostly on account of the fact that the late fifties and early sixties had not yet established the divisiveness of two different cultural mindsets which was ready to surface with our nation ! The unification of ideologies in the United States which prevailed during the debut of " Bonanza " was a big reason for the show 's success ! In the show 's later years , " Bonanza " had established a firmly entrenched core market television audience ! The cast to " Bonanza " became famous , and the wholesome entertainment of " Bonanza " encompassed a camaraderie for the All-American idealist ! Everybody liked " Bonanza " and a lot of Americans totally loved it ! Reflecting on rough and tumble family values is a favorite past time of many Americans , and the television show " Bonanza " was perfect for that frame of mind ! I liked the show a lot , and most people I know like it as well ! Certainly , my entire family loved " Bonanza " ! This show was one of the all time American classics in the history of television !  
  As a young boy , I always sort of hated " Cinderella , " since I was outvoted by my two sisters when my parents were considering what Disney movie to buy . I wanted " Dumbo , " but my sisters won out , and we got " Cinderella . " They thoroughly enjoyed the movie while I sulked in the back of the room playing with my Star Wars action figures . A lot has changed since then . My love of the Disney theme parks landed me an internship at Walt Disney World , and I now have two young nieces . I like to showcase Disney to them as much as I can , and we recently watched " Cinderella " together . With my newfound appreciation for all that is Disney , I watched " Cinderella " with a new perspective and was impressed with what I saw . From the beginning of the movie , though , I didn't quite understand why Cinderella was trapped in such a horrible predicament . Why was she such a slave to her stepfamily , and why couldn't she just run away ? I wasn't too sympathetic to Cinderella , but as the story progressed , I found myself becoming immersed in the story . Maybe the eye-catching animation or the fun-loving characters drew me in , or maybe it was the timeless songs . Listening to songs like " Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo " and " A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes " sort of whisked me back to the theme parks . I can picture myself in that carefree and fun atmosphere while looking at the awe-inspiring Cinderella Castle . Something about this movie just evokes the magic of Disney . That may make many people scoff , but go to the Magic Kingdom and see all the little girls dressed up like Cinderella that are excited to be in this fantasy world , and you 'll know what I 'm talking about . The images of Cinderella and the glass slipper - as well as Mickey Mouse , Winnie the Pooh , and Tinkerbell - embody why Disney is one of the most beloved companies in the entire world . While " Cinderella " may not be the strongest story , it is sort of iconic in Disney and movie history . It represents that fun , idealistic , and fantasy-like wonderment we held when we were kids . I imagine this movie holds a lot of meaning to many , many people out there . It may not be my favorite Disney movie , but it does represent all that I love and admire about the Company . My IMDb Rating : 10/10 . My Yahoo ! Grade : A ( Outstanding )  
  Well I guess it supposedly not a classic because there are only a few easily recognizable faces , but I personally think it is .. It 's a very beautiful sweet movie , Henry Winkler did a GREAT job with his character and it really impressed me .  
  If you ever see a stand up comedy movie this is the one . You will laugh nonstop if you have any sense of humor at all . This is a once in a lifetime performance from a once in a lifetime performer . This is a stand up standard .  
  This is hands down the greatest stand up show ever . I 've seen a lot of stand up shows , been to a lot of stand up shows , and watch Bet 's Comic View , but I have never seen anyone who could match the skills of Murphy on this show . The impressions are excellent , the skits are great , and the timing is perfect . You can even tell the crowd gets really into . When he did Raw a few years later it was also really good , but this is # 1 in my book . Also shows that at one time , particularly the early-to mid eighties , that Murphy was funny . My favorite parts of the show is when he is retelling the family barbecue and " Ice cream ! Moomm ! The ice cream man is coming ! " Another great part is where his mom is like Clint Eastwood .  
  Parker and Stone transplant their pacy expletive-ridden humour from their animated masterpiece to a feature length live action film with generally good results . Much of the film is Trey and Matt running amok with their new toy box . The plot is simplicity itself : two average guys invent a new sport , a blend of driveway basketball with baseball scoring which becomes a national craze . Along the way they encounter numerous sporting movie cliches and send them up , along with any other bit of popular culture that comes into their sights . It runs like a stretched South Park episode , with the usual machine-gun dialogue , toilet humour and homilies from the heart . If this film has a weakness it is the association with the team that gave us " Airplane " and the " Naked Gun " series . This influence is clearly seen with the heavy use of lame sight gags and the presence of a glossy and rather two-dimensional Yasmine Bleeth in the role usually given to Priscilla Presley . Robert Vaughn does a little better playing the corporate b * tard that has been his party piece ever since " Bullitt " and Ernest Borgnine overacts as only he can , but one must admit he 's perfect for the role of the lunatic team owner . For those who haven't noticed yet , Parker and Stone seem to be more comfortable as rock star wannabes than comics . This manifests in the prominence given to the soundtrack in just about everything they create . As usual , they give a good selection here including the obligatory track by their own ultra-non-PC vehicle DVDA . A special mention must go to Dian Bachar , who deserves some sort of award for enduring the difficult job of playing Stan to Parker and Stone 's rampaging pair of Cartmans . In summary , this is an entertaining comedy which is held back from its full potential by too much reliance on the " Naked Gun / Airplane " formula . Parker and Stone could do something truly brilliant ( or absolutely awful ) if given full control over a future film . America , either lock these guys up or put them in charge .  
  Sometimes I just want to laugh . Don't you ? No analyzing , no critiquing and no looking for deeper meaning . Rent this movie , watch it all and laugh your ass off . Don't want to admit you liked it ? Fine . But don't trash it here when you and I both know you liked it . It 's Damn funny !  
  Sublimity is the way we have to reach for The Beauty . And sublimity is the stuff this film is made of . If not his best , it 's my most loved of all Bogdanovich movies . This unique masterpiece remind us , as most of the other films from the director , what life is ( or should be ) about : love , lost ( or failure ) and hope and faith and charity . As the song from whom the films takes its title ( Gershwin 's well known composition ) the film makes the impossible true , and tries to make us aware that no-one is able to judge anybody ; all this with the lightness of a comedy and the timing of a masterful direction ( the first ten minutes , with the detectives following the ladies , almost without a line of dialogue , constructed upon the looks and views of the characters - with that " Bogdanovich touch " based on the point-of-view - is a class on Cinema Language , something that P.B. learned well from his admired directors from the Golden Age of the Movies ) . With a superb cast and a glorious soundtrack ( including the best of Sinatra 's " Trilogy " ) , this movie , full of self-consciousness and compassion , and far away from self-indulgence and emptiness ( as some critics wrote ) , deserves a better place on the History of American Cinema than where it have been placed . It 's not " long on style , short on substance " : it is complex in its simplicity , and beautiful , absolutely beautiful .  
  I 'm amazed we see even one nay-sayer criticizing this old film . We don't ordinarily get good opera films , and here is a true grand opera rendition . Understandably , the visuals are not great . It 's dated . But as opera it can't be faulted ; and I 'm an opera buff . I can't even detect one lip-sync ; if we didn't know that was Tebaldi in the audio nothing would convince me it isn't Sophia Loren . She does EVERYTHING with flair ! Her dark makeup is fine ; and she brought the role to gorgeous life ! The rest of the cast is wonderful , as is that stunning ballet troupe . Most of the actors are excellent ; Loren truly marvelous . Her rival Amneris is also terrific . Whoever didn't care for this 1953 job is shamefully remiss . Verdi would have enjoyed it ! Naturally , Renata Tebaldi as Aida is the engine behind the scenes . I love this old movie !  
  Enjoyed viewing this film on TCM and watching a very young William Powell , ( Philo Vance ) playing detective just like he did with Myrna Loy in the " Thin Man Series " . Back in the 1930 's William Powell played in the Philo Vance Series and in this picture , the famous veteran actress Mary Astor , ( Hilda Lake ) becomes one of the suspects in a murder / suicide case where a man named , Archer Coe , ( Robert Barrot ) is found dead and Archer was in a room that was bolted from the inside . Ralph Morgan , ( Raymond Wrede / Archer 's Secretary ) gave a great supporting role and was the brother to Frank Morgan who appeared " In the Wizard of Oz " 1939 . Eugene Palette , ( Detective Sgt . Heath ) appeared in quite a few of these Philo Vance films and also gave a great performance in " Robin Hood " with Errol Flynn . Always remember , the least likely actor could very well be the killer . Enjoy a great Classic from the past .  
  Cracking good yarn with all the actors giving great value . Michael Curtiz at his best . Lots of nice twists and turns and probably the best of the Philo Vance series . William Powell looks wonderfully relaxed and at his debonair best . A forerunner to the Thin Man series . Recommend to everyone . Did you figure it all out ?  
  Since Douglas MacArthur affected more human livesfor the betterthan any other American not elected President , he deserved a better film biography . Not that Universal 's " MacArthur " is bad . It 's just not all it should have been . Oddly enough , the potential was there . From the very early " Star Trek " episode " The Corbomite Maneuver " ( 1966 ) to the recent HBO films " Something the Lord Made " ( 2OO4 ) and " Warm Springs " ( 2OO5 ) , director Joseph Sargent has emerged as one of the most expressively human directors in film , a man capable of subtly shaping the emotional shadings of his actors ' performances , and carrying the audience exactly where he wants them to go . The producer , Frank McCarthy , also gave us " Patton " ( 197O ) , the legendary Jerry Goldsmith scored both films , and Universal widely touted the fact that the film was " four years in preparation and production . " Yet for all of this , " MacArthur " is perfectly adequateand not much more than that . The film begins in early 1942 , shortly before the beleaguered general was orderedby President Franklin D . Roosevelt ( Dan O'Herlihy ) to flee the Philippines to avoid capture by the Japanese . Thus , this film omits : · MacArthur 's birth in 188O in a frontier barracks in Arkansas still subject to attack by Native American tribesmenthus establishing that his remarkable life spanned the distance from bows-and-arrows to thermonuclear weapons ; · his graduation from West Pointfirst in a class of 95 , · how he joined his famous father , General Arthur MacArthur ( who had earned the Medal of Honor at Missionary Ridge in the Civil War ) on assignments in Japan , China and , most importantly , in the Philippines ; · his heroic exploits in the 1914 excursion into Vera Cruz ; · how he leaped about the trenches of World War One like a mountain goat , often wounded , and promoted with blinding speed to Brigadier General ; · his postwar service as West Point 's youngestand most progressivecommandant ; · his participation in the court-martial of Billy Mitchell in 1924 ; · his routing of the Bonus Marchers in 1932 ; · his efforts to sustain a woefully-underfunded Army as Chief of Staff in the early 193O 's ; · his retirement from the U.S. Army to become Field Marshal ( ! ) of the Army of the Philippines ; · and the reactivation of his commission by FDR shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War . All this is omitted in favor of prolonged footage of MacArthur trying to fight off seasickness while being evacuated by PT boatthus , we know that " General Mac " is a legend , but not why ; nor can we appreciate why the allegations of cowardice were so wounding to " Dugout Doug " and so patently unfounded . The remainder of his career is presently straightforwardly : His island-hopping " Hit ' em where they ain't " campaign , the fulfillment of his pledge to the Filipinos " I shall return ! " his crowning achievement , the winning of the peace in postwar Japan , then the difference of opinion with President Harry Truman ( a properly feisty Ed Flanders ) over the conduct of the Korean conflict which resulted in his outright firing , and finally , his proclamation to Congress that " old soldierssimply fade away , " after which he did just that . All quite historically accurate , and all presented with a very deliberate lack of commentary . Sargent and the producers almost painfully distance themselves from adorning the historical record with their own approval or disapproval : If MacArthur 's actions appear noble , let them be presented as such ; if they appear egotistical or bombastic , let those conceptions register sans comment . Since Joe Sargent is quite expert at subtly manipulating his audience 's reactionsagain , see Warm Springsthis refusal to offer comment appears quite intentional . Historically , that may be commendable , but it almost defeats the efforts of the viewer to place this extraordinary man in any kind of rational perspective . And finally , there is a sort of " made on the cheap " feel to the film , as there is to " Midway , " released about the same time . Both films were relegated to " television " directors-Sargent in this case , Jack Smight on " Midway , " and both have a made for TV look . Even Jerry Goldsmith 's march , while perfectly serviceable , lack the subtle undertones and the grandeur of his " Patton " theme-just another way in which a larger-than-life man is memorialized by a very ordinary film . There was vanity and pettiness in this man , inarguably ; there was also greatnessand love him or loathe him , one must acknowledge the fact that MacArthur did what no military commander before him had done : he won the peace . In the end , " MacArthur " like so many film biographiesis a good place to begin research into this remarkable man , but a poor place to end it .  
  You probably all already know this by now , but 5 additional episodes never aired can be viewed on ABC . com I 've watched a lot of television over the years and this is possibly my favorite show , ever . It 's a crime that this beautifully written and acted show was canceled . The actors that played Laura , Whit , Carlos , Mae , Damian , Anya and omg , Steven Caseman - are all incredible and so natural in those roles . Even the kids are great . Wonderful show . So sad that it 's gone . Of course I wonder about the reasons it was canceled . There is no way I 'll let myself believe that Ms . Moynahan 's pregnancy had anything to do with it . It was in the perfect time slot in this market . I 've watched all the episodes again on ABC . com - I hope they all come out on DVD some day . Thanks for reading .  
  I saw the The Bourne Ultimatum last summer with a friend , and , wow ! I had already seen the first two films and I liked them , but Ultimatum , I loved . Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne , a amnesia suffering CIA agent on the run , trying to discover who he is . Like I already said , I loved this movie from start to finish , no plot holes , slow scenes , everything was paced just right and it fit in well with the other films , but in all senses it was much better . Best stunts , car chases , actors , and effects I 've seen in an action movie all summer , ( surprisingly due to Spider-Man 3 , Pirates , etc . ) But I it wasn't just action in this film , Jason doesn't just kill and run . He has a soul and the audience feels for him , so drama is included . But that doesn't slow it down . Of all the " threequels " that came out last summer , this was the best .  
  This movie was excellent . I was not expecting it to live up to all the hype but it did . Like all the Bourne movies the action is fast paced , realistic and intense . If you liked the other two movies in the trilogy you will love this one also . The movie 's plot is straightforward and there are no plot twists that are too unrealistic . OK , Julia Stiles character showing up in the Italian safe house was kind of far-fetched especially after what happened in Supremacy but it makes sense that she is the only character in " Treadstone " that Bourne knows , that does not want him dead and he could possibly trust and the only person to lead him in the right direction . The action is driven by characters and their reactions to what is happening all around them . The thing that I always loved about the Bourne movies is that Bourne can kick butt but when matched with people as good as he is the fights are struggles and he takes a lot of damage in them . They never treat the audience like idiots . All the actors were solid in their performances . I believe that Damon could play Bourne in his sleep and receives excellent support from Joan Allen reprising her role from Supremacy , David Strathairn and Scott Glenn . I recommend this film and the trilogy . I do miss Franka Potente though .  
  I am Black American and I loved this soap opera . I watched it dubbed in Spanish on Telemundo , almost 5-7 years ago . The story was a TRUE story about a black slave who 's love affair with a white commander led to her leadership and candid , whimsical way of living . A lot of us could learn a lot from XICA . She took what she had , nothing , and saw her possibilities . Many would argue that she sold herself out - but she was trying to secure her future and that of her future children . It was such an excellent soap opera , that I thought it would be released on DVD , but it 's not being released . This soap opera was the best soap opera EVER . We need for it to be released on DVD or broadcast on TV again . It 's playing on Azteca America right now , which is only available in Mexico or in the US by paid cable . We need it released again to Telemundo .  
  In the movie several references are made in subtly to Blade runner , but one of the most obvious is the fact the Cain 607 and his unit are all genetic constructs , breed to be expendable warriors . But as favorite quote of mine from the movie is , " you should have made them smart as well as fast " . Kurt Russell did a incredible job , his facial expressions or lack of in the movies gave more in the way of relating the story then the rest of the cast combined . Even when he falls in love with Sandra but does not know how to deal with these emotions , and his tears after being expelled from the group , or his shuddering when he is given a hug , and his attachment to the mute young boy who in many ways reminded Todd of himself , and what he could have been if not for his selection to be a soldier .  
  I don't know why I like this movie so well , but I never get tired of watching it .  
  Besides the fact that it was one of the few movies that I ever shed a tear over ( bye-bye manhood ) , this is one of the most beautifully crafted Indian films that has ever been made . From the finely crafted sets , to those haunting looks Meena Kumari gives , no one can ever forget it . The music of Pakeezah is amazing , all the more if you can understand the sublime poetry , and is definitely one of those " OMG , 5 minutes another song " movies . You get the feeling of how trapped Sahibjaan is in among all the amazing jewelery she wears and fountained court yard she casually walks past . A parody of all the dreams you 've ever had ..  
  A common plotline in films consists of the main characters leaving the hustle and bustle of the city behind , and finding themselves in the tranquility of nature . In Power of Kangwon Province , we are shown two stories of individuals doing just that , trying to find themselves through a trip to the popular Korean parks in the mountains of Kangwon Province . However , rather than epiphanal moments , we have two characters whose trip into nature was just another form of escape . The pace of this movie is slow , contemplative . We learn in the end what really brought each to Kangwon Province and we learn how they 're connected . For those who want Hollywood glam and for a movie to give them a definitive answer , this movie will not satisfy . But for those who want a movie that leaves them thinking , wondering , affecting them years after , this movie will more than satiate that longing .  
  Bette Midler is again Divine ! Raunchily humorous . In love with Burlesque . Capable of bringing you down to tears either with old jokes with new dresses or merely with old songs with more power & punch than ever . All in All Singing new ballads , power-singing the good old / perennial ones such as " The Rose " ; " Stay With Me " and yes , even " Wind Beneath My Wings " . The best way to appreciate the Divine Miss M has always been libe - since this is the next best thing to it , I strongly recommended to all with a mixture of adult wide-eyed enchantment and appreciation and a child 's mischievous wish for pushing all boundaries !  
  Yes , commitment . Let 's say " Fever Pitch " might trick you into believing it 's a baseball movie . But no , you don't have to be a baseball fan to actually enjoy this picture from the Farrelly Brothers . But of course , if you are one , you will enjoy it even more ; with all the references ( pretty accurate ones , I 'd say ) to the Boston Red Sox and its bittersweet history ; from the Curse of the Bambino and everything attributed to it , including those two words you CANNOT pronounce in front of a Boston fan : Bill Buckner . Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon portray two people who , usually might have second thoughts of going into a relationship : the successful workaholic who is also affluent meeting a school teacher ? Thing is , Fallon 's character wins Barrymore 's heart by being funny , caring , sweet and downright perfect . But her friends ask her a logical question : if he 's such a keeper , why is he still on the market ? Enter the Boston Red Sox . He 's been so committed to his team ever since his uncle passed his Sox season tickets to him ; he has never missed a Red Sox home game at Fenway Park in a long while . And that delicate balance , how much is the workaholic willing to give up for his guy 's obsession ; and how much is that baseball-crazed teacher willing to compromise in order to keep the OTHER love of his life , is what this movie is all about . At first , you might think that the sports-obsession bits of the movie are exaggerated for comic relief . Well , I 'm sad to admit , they are not . Myself , as a die-hard Houston Astros fan , can say they are all true . I would try at every way available to see every ' Stros game ; listen to them on the radio or follow them on the Internet . I read the Chronicle 's sports section every day . And yes , my room looks like The Shed , Minute Maid Park 's gift shop ; with a closet full of Astros gear , including 5 jerseys , 20 t-shirts and you know the rest . Fallon 's character even has the Red Sox MBNA MasterCard . Fallon was credible enough as the fanatical Red Sox faithful , even though he could pull it off without becoming a cartoon ( Thank God Adam Sandler wasn't in it ) ; and the plot revolved around how this couple tried to manage with each other 's passions . I 'd say it 'll be a classical romantic comedy . Not enough to be among the best movies in history ; but certainly breaks a mold into the genre and is appealing enough for men and women alike .  
  A SPECIAL DAY ( Ettore Scola - Italy / Canada 1977 ) . Every once in a while , you come across a film that really touches a nerve . This one offers a very simple premise , almost flawlessly executed in every way and incredibly moving at the same time . It 's surprising Ettore Scola 's " Una giornate particulare " is relatively unheralded , even hated by some critics . Time Out calls it ' rubbish ' and Leonard Maltin , somewhat milder , ' pleasant but trifling . ' I disagree , not only because this film is deeply moving , but within its simple story it shows us more insights about daily life in fascist Italy than most films I 've seen . The cinematography is distinctly unflashy , even a bit bland , and the storyline straightforward , which might explain the film 's relative unpopularity . Considering late ' 70s audiences weren't exactly spoiled with great Italian films , it 's even stranger this one didn't really catch on with the critics . The film begins with a ten-minute collage of archive footage from Hitler 's visit to Italy on may 8th 1938 . Set against this background , we first meet Antonietta ( Loren ) , a lonely , love-ridden housewife with six children in a roman apartment building . One day , when her Beo escapes , she meets her neighbour Gabriele ( Mastroianni ) , who seems to be only one in the building not attending the ceremonies . He is well-mannered , cultured and soon she is attracted to him . During the whole film , we hear the fascist rally from the radio of the concierge hollering through the courtyard . Scola playfully uses the camera to make us part of the proceedings . After the opening scene , the camera swanks across the courtyard of the modernist ( hypermodern at the time ) apartment block , seemingly searching for our main characters , whom we haven't met yet . Marcello Mastrionani and Sophia Loren are unforgettable in the two leading roles , all the more astonishing since they are cast completely against type . Canadian born John Vernon plays Loren 's husband , but he is only on screen in the first and last scene . I figure his voice must have been dubbed , since he 's not of Italian descent and never lived there , to my knowledge , so I cannot imagine he speaks Italian . If his voice has been dubbed , I didn't notice at all . On the contrary , he 's completely believable as an Italian , even more than the rest of the cast . The story is simple but extremely effective , the performances are outstanding , the ending is just perfect and the framing doesn't come off as overly pretentious but works completely . Don't miss out on this one . Camera Obscura - 9/10  
  DOCTEUR PETIOT , starring Michel Serrault , is a brutal story about a brutal man . A doctor who heals the sick in occupied France , even if their ability to compensate is not there . Yet , he preys on the weakest amidst the populace . The imagery and cinematography are superb , and lend an additional macabre feeling to this complex story . He is the perfect psychopath . Seductive and altruistic , intelligent and caring , calculating and murderous . A movie certain not to be forgotten soon by the viewer . Kudos to Mr . Serrault , for his chilling portrayal .  
  Having never heard of this film until I saw the rental DVD I as a bit sceptical , there have been many films in the past with good ensemble casts that can't do anything film a bad script , and in some cases don't seem to care . Well having just watched it there was no reason not to give this movie a theatrical release , it IS good . The story like most in this genre can seem a little forced at times but there does appear to be a good amount of realism here too that allows the momentum to carry . I was pleasantly surprised at how good a job Justin Timberlake does here too with such a major role , OK he 's not Oscar material yet , but he 'll learn with each role and he shows a LOT of promise for the future here . Dylan McDermott too was amazingly good in his unexpectedly nasty role and is definitely the cream of the crop in this movie . Ultimately , just give it a go . you won't be disappointed , you won't be bored , in fact , I think you 'll be more than happy with the end result .  
  Steven Spielberg ( at 24 ) had already directed two superb episodes of a 1971 series called " The Psychiatrist " , starring Roy Thinnes . One episode had been about an emotionally troubled 12-year old boy and the other was about a vibrant young man ( Clu Gulager in his best performance ) who is dying of cancer . Both episodes were stunning , visually unlike anything else on TV , and emotionally complex and adult . The creators of " The Psychiatrist " were Richard Levinson and William Link , who created " Columbo " and also produced its first season . Peter Falk insisted on first rank , experienced TV directors for the first season of " Columbo " , like Bernard Kowalski and Jack Smight . But Falk agreed to Spielberg after watching part of the Clu Gulagher episode of " The Psychiatrist " . Spielberg says on the DVD of " Duel " that he loved Steven Bochco 's " Murder by the Book " script ( based on a Levinson / Link story ) , and he tried to make the production look like a million dollar feature , even thought he had a lot less money to work with . This episode of " Columbo " is far more visually stylish and makes better use of the sound track and background music than almost any other " Columbo " episode , even though the series always used top directors . Spielberg manages to keep the great Falk and Cassidy from hamming it up too much , but both actors are still a lot of fun . Spielberg also gets fine supporting work from Martin Milner , Rosemary Forsyth and Barbara Colby . All the performances have a freshness and vitality about them . The only " Columbo " episode that was close to being as well directed is the " By Dawn 's Early Light " episode with Patrick McGoohan ( directed by Harvey Hart ) . I think the two episodes of " The Psychiatrist " and this episode of " Columbo " suggest Spielberg hasn't developed technically all that much as a director . He was great from the beginning . In a " Combat ! " DVD commentary of a 1962 episode guest starring Albert Salmi , Robert Altman says that episode was pretty much as good as he ever got as a director . Maybe the same is true of Spielberg .  
  I saw this film a while back and it 's still at the top of my ' favorite movies ' list . It is amazingly put together and what really makes the film are the detailed tid bits ( such as the ' Cafe Bustelo ' coffee crate being reused as a cup to wash her grandsons hair ) that people aren't seeing because YOU WILL NOT UNDERSTAND THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU ARE HISPANIC . This is just one of those films that is very culturally specific and particular . Please do not bash this film if you have no prior knowledge of what foundation it 's being built upon . I completely see what the writer / director was going for , and he hit the target perfectly ! This film is highly deserving of a better rating .  
  True fans of film will love this authentic movie . I disagree with the trolls who are rating this movie a one-star and calling it unrealistic . While I don't have the background or come from the environment of the protagonists , I 've spent many years working in lower income and working class neighborhoods and feel the acting was very real and representative of how teenagers behave . I don't know what the basis is for others ' comments that the film is " unrealistic " . The dialog is great . The low budget production value didn't bother me a bit . I felt that the natural lighting enhanced the character of the film . The focus was entirely on the story line and character development and not glitzy Hollywood propping or melodrama . I completely bought into the character 's motivations and reactions . The acting was believable and impressive for new and non-actors . If your idea of good film is Transformers or Fast & Furious , then skip it . If you enjoy good character driven dramas , then see it . ( Regarding the negative commenters being " trolls " : click on their names and you will see most have no other reviews or only negative reviews . )  
  The premise is a bit better than the execution , but that doesn't mean the film is worth a look . Splendid supporting cast makes this a fun mystery to unravel . Raines is great as the resourceful woman determined to solve this puzzlement . I always enjoy Thomas Gomez .  
  * WARNING - CONTAINS SPOILERS ! * First of all , I would like to say that I really liked this game . I got it for Christmas after two months of dropping hints to my parents . I am glad that I did that . First off , I would like to say that the single player was very good . The first level is probably one of the best in the game , when you are at a party in London , and some evil guys ruin it by kidnapping the Prime minister 's daughter . Of course you have to rescue her , and it is quite a big level , but should probably take you at least five minutes . The best part , and I think also the funniest part , is when you are in the jet-pack , and people are rappelling down Big Ben . Just equip the jet-pack 's most trusty rocket launcher and blast the clock faces and the enemies down . Pure fun ! The rest of the levels are very good , but pretty short . There are four mini-levels you can unlock , and that is one of the let downs , because only the first two of them are actually fun , and the last two to unlock are just ' kill 25 enemies ' objectives , I mean , c'mon ! We got loads of points to unlock these missions and the last two bonus missions are really bad ! The multi player , me and some of my friends agree , is very good and challenging , even if there are no bots . Halo didn't have any bots but that is still some fine multi player games ! You can be a load of bad guys , and you go against each other , and you can also set traps , which is the best way of killing people without going into view of their character . Gameplay - 8.5/10 ( levels can be quite repetitive and bonus missions could be improved ) . Graphics - 9/10 ( there is the odd bad graphic , but that isn't extremely often ) . Multiplayer - 10/10 ( needs no comment , just great , you get to drive in jet-packs and vehicles ) . Sound - 8/10 Replay value - 7/10 ( the only levels I go back on are the Loondon level and Istanbul Part 1 ) . I give this game : 8.5/10 Could have a bit of improvement , but it 's still good .  
  { Possible spoilers coming up .. you 've been forewarned . } This is absolutely one of my all time favorite musicals and movie musicals ! ( The other is Damn Yankees with Gwen Verdon , Tab Hunter and Ray Walston ) As we all know , sometimes the luster ( not to mention the songs ) of a show are lost in its transition from stage to screen . This is , for the most part , DEFINITELY not the case here . The sets are divine , bright and colorful , the characters are bigger than life and you can't help but love them , and Michael Kidd 's choreography is absolutely stunning . ( So glad to know they used the original Broadway choreographer ) All of the actors " bounce the ball " ( that is , have unbeatable chemistry ) to perfection in this film . Frank and Marlon are absolutely believable as the proprietor of the oldest established permanent floating crap game in New York , and the most notorious gambler who bets on even the most minute things - such as his fever going up to 104 if he doesn't take penicillin . Sweet , fresh faced Jean Simmons is perfect for the role of Sarah ( although it is true , her singing pipes are not as outstanding as that of Isabel Bigley or Josie de Guzman ) - the mission doll with a heart of gold and a drive to heal all . And last but certainly not least ( on my list anyway ) is Miss Vivian Blaine , reprising her Broadway role as Miss Adelaide - the Hot Box lead singer and dancer who would like to finally end her 14 year engagement to Nathan with marriage , and rid herself of the psychosomatic cold he 's given her . First off , kudos to Stubby Kaye and B.S. Pulley as they reprise their Broadway roles as Nicely-Nicely Johnson and Benny Southstreet . There were never two more loveable gamblers than these guys . Brando is superb , as usual , and though he 's not got the voice of Robert Alda or Peter Gallagher , you forget it - as he has this sense of determination to bring all he can to his role as Sky Masterson . " Luck Be A Lady " gives me chills every time I see him perform the number . Especially enjoyable is hearing him say " Daddy .. I got cider in my ear . " Simmons is charming and pleasant in a role well suited to her looks , voice and the way she carries herself . You long so dearly for her not only to win Sky ( or , toward the end , believe him ) , but to help people overcome their gambling , drinking and other sins , and live a life with God . Her rendition of " If I Were A Bell " is splendid , to say the least ! Sinatra is the man . He is so perfect for the role of Nathan Detroit - and here he sings parts that Sam Levene from the Broadway cast never could ( terrific actor , but the chap was tone deaf .. go figure ) . I really enjoyed the addition of the song " Adelaide " .. wish some guy would sing like that to ME . Frankie 's cool , slick demeanor transcends the boundaries of this movie . But most importantly , you want him to marry Adelaide . And speaking of Adelaide , Vivian Blaine is just sheer perfection in this role . From the accent to her belting out " Adelaide 's Lament " , she 's just terrific . And she 's also my favorite part of the entire movie . She really makes you feel for Adelaide .. especially when she cries right before and then again during " Sue Me " . I still haven't decided whether I like " Pet Me Poppa " better than " Bushel and a Peck " .. maybe I like them equally . Either way , she does fantastic with those as well as " Take Back Your Mink . " ( I 'm sad that they left out " hollanderize " from the film .. ) She 's absolutely MARVELOUS , not to mention hilarious , and my favorite part of the entire film . One of the best things about this movie is their lingo . It 's a mixture of high class and street slang . Never do they use " It 's " , " I 'll " or " That 's . " It 's always " It is " , " I will " and " That is . " Overall , Guys & Dolls is one of my favorite all time movies and musicals , and it 's one that you should take time to watch every time it comes on . My only complaint ? No " Marry The Man Today . " Now THAT 'S a good song .  
  Creative use of modern and mystical elements : 1956 Cadillac convertible to transport evil stepmother Kathleen Turner ( John Waters ' " Serial Mom " ) and the 2 twisted sisters ; Queen Mab as the faerie godmother ; David Warner ( Evil in " Time Bandits " ) in redcoat at court ; Cinderella ( she 's a babe ) shovelling coal into an insatiable furnace ; Cinderella and her prince charming both look like ( and act like ) rock stars . Isle of Man locations .  
  I really like this film .. when I started to watch it I thought I would get bored pretty soon , but it surprised me .. I thought it was a great film and have seen it a few times now . The characters are believable and I have to say that I fell in love with Brian Austin Green all over again ( the first time being Beverly Hills 90210 ) . I would recommend this film if you are a fan of his , but I do agree with another comment made earlier , that the ending is sort of disappointing . I would have loved it to turn out a little different ! Never mind though , good gripping story .  
  I just saw this movie the other day when I rented it , and I thought this was going to be just another movie with a girl trying to prove a point , but Diane joined boxing because she wanted to . I thought this movie was good . I gave it a 8/10 . That 's how good it is . Plus a movie with Michelle Rodriguez is always good . Even is she 's been in only six .  
  Another powerful chick flick . This time , it revolves around Diana Gusman who is always getting into fights at school . Instead of getting expelled , she takes her anger elsewhere , to the boxing ring . She trains to be a boxer and there she meets featherweight Adrian and begins to fall in love with him . This movie has a powerful message of taking your dreams and going with them even if someone doesn't believe in you ( in this case , her dad doesn't believe in her ) . That alone makes the movie worth the price . Enjoy  
  This movie is a real gem . The arc of the the plot is defined in the first 3 minutes , the characters are sympathetic and clearly drawn , their motives completely believable . The dialogue is fresh , and oh so real . The situations are unique to the characters and not at all cliched or hackneyed . Until the climax , that is . Then it 's as if the movie went off the rails a bit and it got a bit hokey and unbelievable . But I don't want to discourage people from watching this film . The first 3/4 's of it are truly remarkable . I gave it an 8 . There are some remarkable performances here . Check out this movie .  
  When I saw the elaborate DVD box for this and the dreadful Red Queen figurine , I felt certain I was in for a big disappointment , but surprise , surprise , I loved it . Convoluted nonsense of course and unforgivable that such a complicated denouement should be rushed to the point of barely being able to read the subtitles , let alone take in the ridiculous explanation . These quibbles apart , however , the film is a dream . Fabulous ladies in fabulous outfits in wonderful settings and the whole thing constantly on the move and accompanied by a wonderful Bruno Nicolai score . He may not be Morricone but in these lighter pieces he might as well be so . Really enjoyable with lots of colour , plenty of sexiness , some gory kills and minimal police interference . Super .  
  Despite Disney 's best efforts , this is a rather enjoyable movie about following your dreams . I was surprised that it didn't strike me as over-sentimental ; this movie played fair . Dennis Quaid was very , very good in the role , which is saying something for a sports movie . I can't recall how many sports movies have had little quirks that bother me ; here , everybody looks the part . This movie is surprisingly good , and I predict that it will do surprising business as it is a G-rated movie that doesn't require the viewer to stop thinking . Ebert to the contrary , this movie is a success .  
  This effort is based on the true story of Jim Morris , a high school science teacher / baseball coach , who is inspired by his players to try out for the pros and fulfill his life-long dream of playing in the majors . Dennis Quaid , no stranger to sports films , plays Morris with enough conviction to make the part work and the producers do a credible job of recreating the real-world events that led to Morris brief stint as a relief pitcher for the woefull Tampa Bay Devil Rays . The first half of the film , dealing with his rag tag bunch of High School Baseball players ( all of whom look way too old to actualy be in High School ) is less effective and probably a bit too long . Overall the film does suffer from some pacing issues and a few extra subplots that we probably could have done without . However , it is still a fairly involving movie with an inspirational theme that proves once again that baseball is the national pastime for a reason . GRADE : B-  
  What a fun movie experience ! I was expecting a sappy kids movie and found that I enjoyed it more than my teens . Take a tissue , it 's not sad , just ' moving ' in parts . Finally , its a ' feel good ' flick for the whole family . Note : It 's 2 + hours , so consider leaving the littlest ' squirmers ' home for this one . AP  
  The film had many fundamental values of family and love . It expressed human emotion and was an inspiring story . The script was clear ( it was very easy to understand making it perfect for children ) and was enjoyable and humorous at times . There were a few charged symbols to look for . The cinematography was acceptable . There was no sense of experimentation that a lot of cinematographers have been doing today ( which quiet frankly is getting a little warn out ) . It was plainly filmed but had a nice soft quality to it . Although editing could have been done better I thought it was a nice movie for a family to enjoy . And the organization of information was just thrown at you which was something I didn't like either but in all it was a good movie .  
  this a great Disney flick . it is the story of an aging high school baseball coach ( Dennis Quaid ) , who was once on his way to the big leagues as a pitcher , but suffered a career ending injury . but through series of events , Jimmy Morris ( Quaid ) gets a try out with a major league team and even makes the roster . this is a great family film . it is inspirational , but doesn't pour it on too thick . it 's fun and entertaining . adults will enjoy this movie as well as kids . it is based upon a true story , though i 'm sure the filmmakers took some liberties in telling the story . Quaid is sensational as the title character , very convincing . if you 're looking for a film the whole family can enjoy , look no further . 9/10  
  Once upon a time Hollywood produced live-action , G-rated movies without foul language , immorality , and gore-splattered violence . These movies neither insulted your intelligence no manipulated your emotions . The heroes differed little from the crowd . They shared the same feelings and bore the same burdens . Since the 1970s , the film industry has pretty much written off G-rated movies for adults . Basically , modern mature audiences demand large doses of embellished realism for their cinematic diet , laced heavily with vile profanity , mattress-thumping sex , and knuckle-bruising fisticuffs . These ingredients constitute the difference between G-rated movies and those rated either PG or PG-13 . Miraculously , director John Lee Hancock , who penned scripts for Clint Eastwood 's " A Perfect World " ( 1993 ) and " Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil " ( 1997 ) , hits a home run with this G-rated , feel-good , four-bagger of a baseball epic that not only celebrates America 's favorite summer time sport , but also extols the competitive spirit of the game . Essentially , " The Rookie " resembles the 1984 Robert Redford saga " The Natural " about an old-time slugger who makes a comeback . Unlike " The Natural , " " The Rookie " shuns swearing , sex , and violence . Moreover , rugged Dennis Quaid plays a real-life individual . Jim Morris ' autobiography , " The Oldest Rookie : Big-League Dreams from a Small-Town Guy , " served as the basis for Mike " Finding Forrester " ) Rich 's unpretentious , Norman Rockwell-style screenplay about white , middle-class aspirations . Morris attained his dream when he debuted on the mound as a relief pitcher in 1999 . Although it doesn't belong in the same league with the inspirational James Stewart classic " The Stratton Story " ( 1949 ) , " The Rookie " qualifies as the kind of movie that Hollywood rarely makes anymore because audiences find them antiquated . Hancock and Rich encapsulate their entertaining oddball biography in a halo of mysticism . A wildcat oil prospector convinces two Catholic nuns back in the 1920s to bankroll a West Texas well . Fearing they have blown their bucks on an ill-advised fantasy , the sisters blanket the arid terrain with rose petals and entreat St . Rita 's patron saint of hopeless causes ' to intervene . The well gushes ! The Town of Big Lake emerges , and roughnecks swat at baseballs when they aren't drilling holes in the terrain . The spirit of baseball oozes from the earth like petroleum . Meanwhile , years later , the U.S. Navy doesn't keep Jim Morris , Sr . , ( Brian Cos of " Manhunter " ) and his family in one place long before uprooting them . The constant moving takes a toll on Jim Junior . Jim 's dad shows little sympathy and berates baseball . Nevertheless , Jim has baseball in his blood , enough so that when he accepts a high school chemistry teacher 's job in his Texas hometown , he organizes a baseball team . Like the foul-mouthed " Bad News Bears , " " The Rookie " chronicles Jim 's triumph at turning losers into winners . Morris promises the team if they reach the divisional playoffs , he will try out for a professional baseball team . Predictably , Morris ' students maintain their end of the bargain . At age 35 , Jim stuns the big league scouts when he hurls fastballs at 98 miles-per-hour ! " The Rookie " never fouls out .  
  I 've seen a lot of TV movies in my time as a student , the majority the normal waste of time that US television throws out . This one , however , was well crafted and plotted and had a very nice twist at the end . Having only seen Richard Dean Anderson in MacGyver and Stargate I was surprised with his excellent performance rather than the rather gamut of expressions from A-B that he normally gives . It was a pleasant surprise to see Daphne Zuniga after quite a long time dating back to The Fly II . Also nice to see Robert Guillaumme in a leading role again . I can't say that I ever take Jane Leeves seriously after her Benny Hill days but she just about managed to cope well in her role . All in all a highly recommended film .  
  Paris Je T ' aime is a movie that explores the different kinds and aspects of love and all the emotions that it provokes . This movie reunites some of the best directors from around the world such as Gus Van Sant , Joel and Ethan Coen , Walter Salles a .. ( read more ) nd Alfonso Cuaron to tell short stories about love located in Paris , each one with their particular way of directing . In this film we also have one of the best cast ever seen in a movie including such great actors like Willem Dafoe , Steve Buscemi , Natalie Portman , Elijah Wood , Gerard Depardieu and many more each one with great performances . In conclusion , this movie is a compilation of stories of happiness , separation , unexpected encounters and love .  
  Ok , so it 's an adult movie . But it really is very tastefully done . It 's obvious that the producers spent a lot of time and money into making a classy sort of movie . I was pleasantly surprised at just how good it was . Even the acting was fairly decent . The plot was more solid than most adult films I 've seen . The camera work was above average . It 's just a good flick !  
  I 've seen this movie at least fifty times and after watching it last week for the first time in a long time I still FELT it . The story itself was incredible but came alive by Spielberg 's expertise and the fabulous cast including Whoopi Goldberg , Oprah Winfrey , Danny Glover , and Margaret Avery . Akosua Busia deserved an Oscar nomination for her short but powerful portrayal of Nettie . You 'll experience every human emotion while watching this film . I laughed , cried , and got angry . Like most great movies it was looked over by the Academy with a host of nominations but no wins . But this movie , without a doubt , is definitely one of the best films of all time .  
  " The Gingerbread Man is the first thriller I 've ever done ! "  Robert Altman In 1955 Charles Laughton directed " The Night of the Hunter " , a spooky slice of Southern Gothic in which Robert Mitchum plays a scary serial killer . One of the film 's more famous sequences consists of two kids escaping from Mitchum on a rowboat , the kids frantically paddling whilst Mitchum wades after them like a monster . Seven years later Mitchum played an equally spooky killer in " Cape Fear " , another film set in the American South . That film featured a local attorney trying to protect his family and likewise ended with Mitchum terrorising folks on a boat . In 1991 Martin Scorsese , trying to branch out and tackle something more mainstream , remade " Cape Fear " , boat scene and all . Now we have Robert Altman 's " The Gingerbread Man " , another slice of small town Southern Gothic . Altman says he consulted " The Night of the Hunter " for inspiration and tackled such a mainstream film purely because he wanted to " spread his wings and try a popcorn picture " , but what he 's secretly attempting to do here is deconstruct the canonical films of the Southern Gothic genre . So instead of a showdown on small boat , we get a showdown on a giant ship . Instead of two kids being kidnapped , we get two kids being safely returned to the police . Instead of money being hidden , we have money being readily given via a last will and testament . Instead of the righteous attorney of the 1961 film and the deplorable attorney of the 1991 remake , we get a rather three-dimensional lawyer in Kenneth Branagh . Instead of the monster chasing the family we get the hero chasing the bad guys . Instead of the monster breaking into the family 's house boat , we have the hero hunting the monster on board the monster 's " house ship " . Similarly , instead of a murderous serial killer we get an innocent weirdo played by Robert Duvall . . . etc etc etc . Altman goes on and on , reversing everything just a little slightly , pulling at the edges and doing his own thing . His touch is most apparent during the film 's first half-hour , the film existing in an uneasy space between conventional plot-driven movie storytelling and Altman 's fondness for overlapping dialogue , casual narratives , prowling camera movement and the way that characters aren't so much introduced as they are simply part of what 's going on . Still , despite Altman 's best intentions , the film never rises above mediocrity . Altman 's too bound to the conventions of the " thriller format " to do much damage , his style is too lethargic to generate tension and the film is simply not radical enough to counterpoint other canonical films in the genre . " Gingerbread Man " is thus too mainstream to work as a more pure Altman film and too Altman to work as a mainstream thriller . The film 's not a complete waste , though . Robert Downey Junior , Kenneth Branagh and the usually intolerable Daryl Hannah , all turn in juicy performances . The film also has a nice atmosphere , set against a approaching hurricane , and the final act contains some interesting twists and turns . While it 's not the complete disaster that Scorsese 's " Cape Fear " was , the film still never amounts to anything special . 7/10  In the late 90s Altman made 3 successive films set in the American South : " Kansas City " , " Gingerbread Man " and " Cookie 's Fortune " . Unlike " Gingerbread Man " , both " Kansas City " and " Cookie 's Fortune " tackle the genre on the broader , more looser canvases that Altman was most comfortable with . " Kansas City " is the more important of these two films , its hierarchies of class , politics and crime , and its desire to break radically away from typical gangster genre frameworks , would prove influential on all serious 21st century film crime writers ( see , for example , " The Wire " ) . That said , " Cookie 's Fortune " , while a much slighter tale , is perhaps the better picture . Note : Altman claims that this is his first thriller , but he directed " Images " , an art house thriller , in 1972 . Worth one viewing .  
  I had an uncle who committed suicide after serving in Vietnam because of mental problems he experienced after coming back . So when I saw part of this movie one night on a pay-for-view channel I was intrigued . I wanted to know what my uncle went through and felt as he got ready for Vietnam . I went out and rented this movie and I have to say it is the most heart-wrenching film I have ever seen . I bought the DVD immediately after renting it . The way it pulls you in so many different directions emotionally is something I 've never experienced with any other film . As far as Vietnam subject films go , I think it is the best one , although Platoon runs a close second . Besides all of that , I think it is also Colin Farrell 's best performance as an actor . I like him in most of his movies but in this one he was incredible . I gave this a 10 rating because it is one of my top five favorite movies .  
  I know that you 've already entered this in film festivals ( or at least I think you have , I may just be making that up ) but I think this should get " best animated short film " in every one . Bravo . I can't wait for the full film . I realize that you may not hear this often enough because of the bizarre nature of your animations , but hear it now and accept it as the truth . Kudos , my friend . Okay , now I 'm just trying to get ten lines of text .. Though I still mean it . And here comes yet another - SHOE ! - and I cannot stop here yet . This is extremely annoying and yet at the same time I have nothing better to do . In fact , I 'll probably watch all of your movies in yet another spasmodic " Jason Steele Marathon . " I do have a lot of those . -R  
  I remember this film from many years ago . Certainly the best film on the subject in my experience . The fact that I vividly remember so much of the film after so long a time testifies to its impact . It is difficult to comment on the level of the performances because of the language barrier . But they were nonetheless very powerful . This subject continues to fascinate us even with the passing of years . And it was most effectively treated here , with the proper proportion of historical perspective and skepticism . I wish it would be shown on TV at least once . Or at least be available on tape or DVD . Or is it ? Is some art film archive hoarding a copy of it ?  
  This movie is awesome . If you take it too seriously , of course you will hate it ; however , it 's quantity of " dudes " and " right ons " brings laughs and faint memories of about 15 years ago . I like its ability to make me simply chuckle at obvious jokes and silliness , and its ability to make me want to watch its precursor , " Bill and Ted 's Excellent Adventure " ( 1989 ) . If you are looking for a film full of multifaceted jokes , and totally mature humor , don't watch it ; however , if you want a film that is humorous and silly , yet intelligent and engaging , you will enjoy it . I actually wish more of this sort of picture showed up in today 's theatres . And hey , it 's Keanu Reeves acting the way everyone parodies him as acting .. right .. doesn't get much better than that : )  
  Saw it as critic at the 49 . Internationales Filmfestival Mannheim Heidelberg . As every film that I know and Zelenka is involved in it is simply genious . I love his way of combining different stories and characters . His * Knoflikari * and the truly magic * Powers * ( part of Regina Zieglers * Erotic Tales IV * ) are definitely worth being checked out . Go and get it , folks !  
  This movie is gorgeous . It 's real and down to heart , but at the same time totally crazy . The characters are easy to fall in love with , because they have so many different minds , but each of us could refer to at least on . In Canada , we don't have many movies from Eastern Europe , and for the few I have seen , Loners is one of the best . It 's very funny , and magic . If you want to see something new and refreshing , go see Loners .  
  After watching the trailer I was surprised this movie never made it into theaters , so I ordered the BluRay . I had a great time watching it and have to say that this movie is better than some major animation movies out there . Of course , it has its flaws but I can still really recommend it . The animation is well done , very entertaining and unique and the story kept me watching it all the way to the end . Some of the backdrops are just drop-dead gorgeous and you can see the French talent behind it . I thought that Forest Whitaker 's performance feels a bit lifeless but that is how the character Lian-Chu is depicted in this movie . So overall , thumbs up , I liked it a lot and I hope it is successful enough for all the studios involved to continue making great movies like this . I would recommend to give it a chance and be surprised how great a movie can be with such a small budget . Hektor alone is worth watching the movie since some of his moments are Stitch-like hilarious .  
  Offbeat , slow-paced , entertaining erotic thriller with many graphic and " blasphemous " scenes that will undoubtedly disturb some viewers . However , it 'll be hard even for them not to appreciate the several imaginative sequences this film contains , or to ignore Krabbe 's first-rate performance . Verhoeven maintains an intriguing ambivalence throughout the film , playing with the meaning of the hero 's visions-omens . Unfortunately , in the last 5 minutes everything turns into a blur , and the unsatisfying ending is certainly not as good as the rest of the movie . ( * )  
  I don't know if I 'd consider it a masterpiece of not , but it 's damn near close ; it 's extremely well made , artistic , suspenseful , intricately plotted , thematically challenging and full of bleak foreshadowing and sexual-religious imagery . There 's also some great camera-work from Jan de Bont , an atmospheric score from Loek Dikker and outstanding acting from Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk , the latter giving one of the most sneaky , subtle ' femme fatale ' performance I 've ever seen . Like many other European movies , this movie has an unashamed , non-judgmental attitude toward sex , nudity and the complexities of sexuality and has zero reservations about mixing it all up with religious and / or surrealistic ( some would say blasphemous ) images . In other words , if you can't bear the thought of seeing a lust-driven homosexual envisioning the object of his carnal desire as Jesus crucified on the cross before the two of them go at it inside a cemetery crypt then this might not be the movie for you . What surprised me more is how this bizarre movie managed to completely dodge being a pretentious mess . It mixes the abstract / surreal / parallel fantasy-reality scenes and somehow makes it all work . Like any good mystery , you can see the pieces slowly falling into place as the movie progresses . There is NOT an out of left field resolution here . The movie has direction , there 's no needless filler and once it concludes , you begin to understand the purpose of what may have confused you earlier . If you like the work of Ken Russell and David Lynch , I can almost guarantee you will love this movie . Hell , if you have no idea who they even are , you still might like it . I 'm not going to spoil the plot by getting too detailed , but the film 's opening shot - through a web as a spider catches its prey - sets the stage as Krabbé , as unshaven , smug , bisexual writer Gerard Reve ( interestingly , also the name of the writer whose novel this is based on ) crosses paths with a wealthy , mysterious , sexy woman named Christine ( Soutendijk , melding androgynous stylings with Simone Simon-like innocence / cuteness that 's pretty unnerving ) , who may be a literal ' black widow ' responsible for the deaths of her three previous husbands . The two become lovers and move in with one another , but we 're led to believe ( through Christine 's bizarre behavior and the frequent appearances of another woman - played by Geert de Jong - who may or may not actually exist ) something terrible is boiling under the surface . When another of Christine 's lovers , the young and " beautiful " Herman ( Thom Hoffman ) , shows up at the house , things take an unexpected turn . And that 's all you need to know . THE 4TH MAN was a huge art-house success in much of the world , but didn't make it over to the US until 1984 , where it was awarded the Best Foreign Film of the year from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association . The most common video is the Media release , which has been horribly dubbed . Try to avoid that one and head straight for the newer subtitled Anchor Bay DVD release . Since coming to America , Verhoeven 's career has had its ups and downs . He has made a few decent films ( Flesh & Blood , RoboCop ) and some lousy ones ( Showgirls ) . In fact , Verhoeven 's big hit Basic Instinct is almost like a less interesting , junior league version of The Fourth Man . Soutendjik also tried her hand at acting in America and since GRAVE SECRETS ( 1989 ) and EVE OF DESTRUCTION ( 1991 ) were the best offers she was getting , she headed right back home to the Netherlands .  
  A typical Clausen film , but then again not typical . Clausen writes , directs and play one of the leading roles . This is really a great film about normal people living normal lives trying to make the best of it . The 4 primary actors were fantastic . Fritz Helmut was convincing . You believe that he really is sick . Sonja Richter plays a nurse that really is an actor , but it turns out that she is the best nurse to take care of the old man . Everybody has problems and those who nobody believes in ends up being happy . But nothing good comes easy , they have to fight to win their life and love .  
  Carmen is one of the best films I 've ever seen . It 's hard to say whose performance is best : Antonio Gades , Cristina Hoyos and Laura del Sol are superb . They dance their souls out . It 's a beautiful tale of inseparability of life and myth ; myth penetrates everyday life . Dance becomes life and entire life is danced out . Real people at one and the same time live their own lives and become somebody else , act out the parts of lovers of old . The magic is continuing .  
  At the beginning of the film we watch May and Toots preparing for their trip to London for a visit to their grown children . One can see Toots is not in the best of health , but he goes along . When he dies suddenly , May 's world , begins to spin out of control . The film directed by Roger Michell , based on a screen play by Hanif Kureshi , is a study of how this mother figure comes to terms with her new status in life and her awakening into a world that she doesn't even know it existed until now . May 's life as a suburban wife was probably boring . Obviously her sexual life was next to nothing . We get to know she 's had a short extra marital affair , then nothing at all . When May loses her husband she can't go back home , so instead , she stays behind minding her grandson at her daughter 's home . It is in this setting that May begins lusting after young and hunky Darren , her daughter 's occasional lover . Darren awakes in May a passion she has not ever known . May responds by transforming herself in front of our eyes . May , who at the beginning of the film is dowdy , suddenly starts dressing up , becoming an interesting and attractive woman . She ends up falling heads over heels with this young man that keeps her sated with a passion she never felt before . Having known a couple of cases similar to this story , it came as no surprise to me to watch May 's reaction . Her own chance of a normal relationship with Bruce , a widower , ends up frustratingly for May , who realizes how great her sex is with Darren . The younger man , we figure , is only into this affair to satisfy himself and for a possibility of extorting money from May . Finally , the daughter , Helen discovers what Mum has been doing behind her back when she discovers the erotic paintings her mother has made . The film is a triumph for the director . In Anne Reid , Mr . Michell has found an extraordinary actress who brings so much to the role of May . Also amazing is Daniel Craig . He knows how Darren will react to the situation . Anna Wilson Jones as Helen is also vital to the story as she is the one that has to confront the mother about what has been going on behind her back . Oliver Ford Davies plays a small part as Bruce the older man in Helen 's class and is quite effective . The film is rewarding for those that will see it with an open mind .  
  Lapyuta ( Castle in the Sky ) , more than any of Hayao Miyazaki 's movies , brings the joy of storytelling to the audience . It is the kind of movie that makes one feel like a kid again ; it 's just magical . It 's a crime that it took this long for it to be released in the states , but now that it 's here check it out ! And stick with the original language ; the dub changed my impressions of the characters somewhat , which is something that should be avoided at all costs in a translation of a movie ( or book , whatever . ) I give it a ten / ten .  
  This is one of my all time favorite movies , PERIOD . I can't think of another movie that combines so many nice movie qualities like this one does . This flick has it all : Action , Adventure , Science Fiction , Good vs . Bad and even some Romance ( without even an innocent " peck " on the cheek between the Pazu and Sheeta ) . Maybe best of all , you don't have to be in Mensa to " get it " and enjoy the movie like you do with some of Miyazaki 's other movies ( I don't know about you , but I watch movies to take a break from thinking ) . This is just a flat-out enjoyable movie that everyone will like , so do yourself a favor and go buy it . The only sour note is the American Dubbing . I found Vander-Geek to be just plain annoying . But all is not lost , the original Japanese version is on the two-disc set and it rocks ! Who cares if you can't understand spoken Japanese ? If you can read at a second-grade level then watch the original Japanese recording with English subtitles . You won't regret it .  
  I first saw this movie as a pre-teen , about the age when kids start to think through their identity . I was greatly affected by the scene of the man and the children who he raises as his own . The eldest boy has been taunted that his mother is a prostitute and none of his siblings have the same biological father ( which Kurosawa makes obvious by having children who look nothing like each other ) . The man still persuades tho boy that he is their father by the only definition that counts . The man is acclaimed to be father by all of the children but one , who still prefers her brother . Each of the vignettes are likewise compelling for their own stories and conclusions . It 's a great film , even if it is not the greatest Kurosawa film .  
  This movie is not only the funniest film ever created , it 's the greatest . My hats off to Mr . and Mrs . Zodsworth and the rest of the wacky , wacky cast . Good morning Satan , Want a donut ? See it post haste ! GO SEE IT NOW !  
  What an amazing film . With very little dialogue , the whole story is told with glances and body language . Very involving almost voyeuristic . My only gripe is that it has not been released on video in Australia and is therefore only available on TV . What a waste .  
  Samuel Fuller is an interesting filmmaker , mainly because he had some very inconsistent politics in his films . While " Shock Corridor " and " The Naked Kiss " represented the hypocrisies and lunacy of America and " The Big Red One " was an effective portrait of the horrors of war , " Merrill 's Marauders " painted war as necessary hell and " Pickup on South Street " is about the dangers of communist spies . All of his films make for very entertaining viewing , and even though he was often pigeonholed as a b-filmmaker , Fuller was just as good as any of the major studio contractors . " Pickup on South Street " is no exception , and despite the dated themes , the film-making style is remarkably ahead of its time . Its also a very quickly-pace , tight , and occasionally brutal film noir . The acting across the board is fantastic . Richard Widmark makes for a great anti-hero and Jean Peters is quite sexy as a girl who works for her communist spy boyfriend . The show stealer is Thlema Ritter however , in an absolutely delightful performance as a police stoolie . The angles Fuller employs are great , making the acting sequences all the more exciting and brutal ( this is very violent for its time ) . The camera continuously moves around just as Tarantino and his school would do forty years later . " Pickup on South Street " is a great action-paced noir thriller . " Shock Corridor " remains my favorite Fuller film , but this is a very close second . ( 8/10 )  
  This a rip roaring western and i have watched it many times and it entertains on every level . However if your after the true facts about such legends as Hickcock , Cody and Calamity Jane then look elsewhere , as John Ford suggested this is the west when the truth becomes legend print the legend . The story moves with a cracking pace , and there is some great dialogue between Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur two very watchable stars who help to make this movie . The sharp eyed amongst you might just spot Gabby Hayes as an Indian scout , also there is a very young Anthony Quinn making his debut as Cayenne warrior , he actually married one of Demilles daughters in real life . Indeed its Quinns character who informs Cooper of the massacre of Custer told in flash back , the finale is well done and when the credits roll it fuses the American west with American history . So please take time out to watch this classic western .  
  This film provides the saga of a legendary Wild Bill Hickock . He , Buffalo Bill Cody , and Calamity Jane , are the central characters . As the Civil War closes , Lincoln mentions his concern that the country 's dynamism would be enhanced if people would follow the advice , " Go West , young man , " which , mercifully , the film didn't erroneously attribute to Horace Greeley , as a number of others did . But then , he gets assassinated , and some financiers speculate that they can get rich selling weapons to the American Indians . In the meantime , we see Wild Bill Hickock , who interacts with a small boy , while a steamboat is loading at a dock along the Mississippi . Wild Bill uses a Bowie knife , which he eventually gives to the boy , calling it an " Arkansas Toothpick , " which in reality was a different type of knife , though both were used throughout the frontier . Hickock eventually meets Buffalo Bill Cody , who looks close to the photographs and paintings of the actual man . Cody has just gotten married , and is bringing his bride to the Old West to settle down . When they arrive at their destination , they run into Calamity Jane , who has a crush on Hickock . She looks at Cody 's wife , and asks Buffalo Bill , " Is this your mopsy ? " The line was one that caused the Hayes Board some problem , since one definition of " mopsy " was prostitute . Demille wanted the line in , and one of his aides pointed out that in Beatrix Potter 's books about Peter Rabbit , three of the rabbits were Flopsy , Mopsy , and Cottontail . He pointed this out and asked the censors to identify " the rabbit of ill virtue . " It worked ; the line stayed in . The Indians were getting restless , in part because of the superior weaponry they got from the agent of the Eastern financiers . Cody and Hickock were asked to help scout the area , so that troops could get safely through to a beleaguered area . Cody led the troops ; Hickock went to check out the activities of an Indian chief , who was an old acquaintance , and who was leading some of the hostile Indians . Calamity Jane gets captured , and Hickock gets captured trying to save her . They are brought to the chief , and although neither would talk , torture applied to Hickock breaks Calamity Jane 's willpower , and she tells the route Cody is using . The two are released , and Hickock joins up with Cody and his forces , in part to alert them they 're walking into a trap . With Hickok 's help , they hold off the Indian attack . Hickock decides to go after the gun runners , and finally takes them prisoner . As they 're waiting for authorities , Hickock is gunned down by being shot in the back while playing cards . There are numerous historic anomalies in the film , but it retains the flavor of legend . Pretty good for the 1930s .  
  I watched this last night on TV ( HBO ) . I have to admit , that the tension in this movie was unsurpassed by most other FN era movies . I loved the way Chip would be all calm one moment and then VIOLENT the very next moment . It was classic . Ahh yes . The dames , the villians , the cigars and thuggish cops ! It has it all . This movie delivered all the goods to me . I especially loved the way they mixed communism into the plot , very common for this era of movie . Very daring also since blacklisting was popular in those days . I rate this movie one of the best I have seen in the FN genre !  
  I love this episode of Columbo . Maybe it 's because Ruth Gordon is in it and she is wonderful as successful mystery writer Abigail Mitchell , an American version of Dame Agatha Christie . She is delicious to watch as the perky , lovable author who suffered a terrible loss when her niece died in a drowning accident . She blames her niece 's husband , the nephew . She plans to kill him to avenge her death since the police have abandoned her . I would have loved somebody else than Mariette Hartley to play Veronica . I never really like Hartley in anything personally . And of course with Columbo , there are some laughs like when he questions Veronica at a belly-dancing class . Ruth 's Abigail is a smart sleuth herself and she matches wits with Columbo always played wonderfully by Peter Falk .  
  My observations : Postwar hilarity . Tom Drake and Grandpa from " Meet Me in St . Louis " two years later ( the year I was born ) . Donna Reed charming and pretty . Margaret Hamilton good as always ; smaller part than in " Wizard of Oz " . Spring Byington way prettier , also with the prerequisite perky small nose lacked by Hamilton . Tent scene at end with former boy next door was hilarious . As a two year veteran of Army tents , he looked pretty youthful and inexperienced when I looked into his eyes . I used to work in a department store , and it was just as elegant as this one . Sadly , it has disappeared and faded into obscurity . We were famous for those great show windows that were used to lure passersby into the store , to get them to buy all of that wonderful merchandise . 10/10  
  Todd Rohal is a mad genius . " Knuckleface Jones " , his third , and most fully realized , short film has an offbeat sense of humor and will leave some scratching their heads . What the film is about at heart , and he would almost certainly disagree with me on this , is how a regular Joe finds the confidence to get through life with a little inspiration . Or not . You just have to see for yourself . The short is intermittently making rounds on the festival circuit , so keep your eyes peeled and catch it if you can - you 'll be glad you did . It is hilarious . And check out Todd 's other short films also popping up here and there from time to time : " Single Spaced " and " Slug 660 " .  
  I really enjoyed this movie . The script is fresh and unpredictable and the acting is outstanding . It is a down-to-earth movie with characters one cares about . It brought tears into my eyes a few times but left me with a great feeling afterwards .  
  What can one say about a film that has one of the blackest , most nihilistic , and occasionally most weirdly -I wont say ' sympathetic ' .. I will say ' charismatic ' villains in the history of the Cinema , and the best sword fight since Flynn and Fairbanks were in their heyday ? This is an epic about a stubborn , sometimes foolish , incredibly courageous and honest mans fight for his honor and freedom against tyranny . I loved it . John Hurt and Tim Roth were great villains . Jessica Lange was very moving , tender , and sensual .  
  This movie is one of the sleepers of all time . I gave it a 10 rating . The story is of the famed ' Bushwhackers ' out of Missouri that fought on the side of the South during the War Between the States . The clothing they wore were authentic , the history and why they fought is very accurate and well researched . There was actually one of the battles that did not take place as they depicted .. but not bad for Hollywood . The actors were well cast and were either the most brilliant of actors or the director really know how to get the best from them . I suspect it was a combination of great directing , super casting to find the right people and excellent performing by the actors . Not just one or two .. this movie really jelled ! It has action , romance , suspense , good guys and bad guys ( sometimes depending on your individual perspective ) and history all rolled into one movie . Even has the future Spiderman and Jewel . And she 's good !  
  Gene Kelly , Frank Sinatra , Kathryn Grayson , and Jose Iturbi star in " Anchors Aweigh , " directed by George Sidney . Kelly and Sinatra are Joe and Clarence , two navy guys on leave in Hollywood . They meet a little boy ( Dean Stockwell ) and on taking him home , they meet his aunt ( Grayson ) . Clarence falls for her . She wants an audition for Jose Iturbi . They try to help , but there 's a mix-up . This is a very energetic musical with great dancing and singing by Kelly and Sinatra . Kelly gets to dance with Jerry the Mouse in a delightful sequence . Grayson sings Jalousie and My Heart Sings . Not one of my favorite voices , but she does well . Iturbi 's piano work is beautiful . Sinatra gets to show his versatility and why the girls swooned over him , with those big blue eyes and boyish face . For Kelly , this was a major break for him at MGM . Wonderful movie , very buoyant .  
  SPOILERS Tom and Jerry is a classic cartoon , with a flawless idea , and almost every single short is a gem . While I must say that this is definitely an inferior short compared such other classic Tom and Jerry shorts , there is not way you can hate this cartoon . Sure , it is understandable to say that this is one of the worst of the first Tom and Jerry episodes , and I can say that I agree , but the fact of the matter is that all Tom and Jerry episodes are great , but some are just better than others . Well , this would fit into " others . " Here is the plot of Fraidy Cat . Tom is listening to an old scary radio broadcast , and becomes easily frightened . Jerry observes how scared he is , and tries to scare him even more than he already is . He creates scary dilemmas for Tom , and Tom becomes scared out of his wits , and his lives . Jerry then puts a sheet over a vacuum cleaner and controls it , thus making it look like the vacuum is a ghost . Tom finds out that Jerry did all of this , and chases him . Tom then accidentally bites the house maid . However , at the end Jerry ends up the one becoming scared after he sees his reflection in a flour cup . Overall , this is far from the best Tom and Jerry short out there , but this is still a fun and entertaining piece of time . It makes me wish that there was more cartoons like this . The slapstick and gags in this that make Tom and Jerry famous are as good as ever in this short , but it felt like something was missing in this . It felt slower than most Tom and Jerry shorts . Anyway , this is a good short that does not quite live up to some other Tom and Jerry cartoons , but it is still nice . 7/10  
  This is an excellent film about a traditional working class family in Northern England . Filmed on location in Bolton , it stars James Mason as the father who is the dominant force within his home . Or so it seems . Cleverly , the film , based on the play , portrays the complexities of family life . The supporting cast is terrific as well , with many familiar faces lending support .  
  Francesca Annis , Michael Kitchen AND Robson Green ! Wow , what a trio .. OK , so this is no Anna Karenina , but it is a good love story , very well-written and well-acted by all . Even a few ' laugh-out-loud ' moments mixed in with some pretty serious observations on fidelity , age bias , and parental aging / Alzheimer 's issues . Quirky guitar music added to the story as well . While I have been a fan of Ms . Annis ' since ' Lillie ' ( in the ' 70s ) and Mr . Kitchen 's since ' The Buccaneers ' and ' Enchanted April ' , I have only recently discovered Mr . Green ( ' Me and Mrs . Jones ' , ' Touching Evil ' , etc . ) , making me ask the question - why had I not seen ' Reckless ' until recently ? ! Admittedly more of a ' chick flick ' than something a man will sit through , it is perfect for a rainy afternoon 's lazy viewing .  
  This zippy and fun short from 1916 - the time when Charlie Chaplin and Fatty Arbuckle were the big names in comedy - features the young Oliver Hardy as a ne'er-do-well who has to quickly impress his wealthy uncle by producing a wife and baby for his visit . Of course this does not go smoothly and soon there are rather more wives and babies than he can cope with ; plus the mandatory chases and misunderstandings that are the hallmark of early movie slapstick . Restored well it can be viewed as part of ' The Early Films of Oliver Hardy ' and is now available on DVD , a fine addition to the available corpus of the big screen favourite comedy duo .  
  Based on Christy Brown 's autobiographical novel , this endearing film tells the story of his life , him being affected by cerebral palsy and being considered basically not a person by everyone including his mother . Amazingly , he teaches himself to draw and write using his foot , which is the only part of him he can control . An amazing story of courage with a truly amazing and unforgettable oscar winning performance by Daniel Day Lewis . 9 of 10  
  I 've just returned from a showing of " My Left Foot " at our public library . What an emotional experience - I feel drained and uplifted . It 's the story of Christy Brown , Irish writer and painter , and based on the author 's autobiographical " My Left Foot . " Christy was born with a form of cerebral palsy such that the only limb he had good control of was his left foot . Doctors advised his parents he was hopelessly mentally retarded but his mother didn't give up on him and , somewhat as Annie Sullivan had done with Helen Keller , helped him achieve a breakthrough in which he learned the alphabet and then to read , write , and paint . This film won Academy Awards for Daniel Day-Lewis ( best actor ) as well as best supporting actress for the actress playing his mother ; it also received Oscar nominations for best picture , best director , and best adapted screenplay . As a retired clinical psychologist and family therapist , while many films may entertain me , many also often leave me having to overlook gross fictions or improbabilities in realistic psychological reactions . Not this film-it was absolutely " spot on " in portraying typical Irish parental roles & behaviors ( see , e . g . , see typical Irish families in McGoldrick 's " Ethnicity & Family Therapy " ) as well Christy Brown 's uneven emotional maturation-some immature personality reactions that were even further amplified by his picking up traits of his father . The film presents the greater truth while changing certain sequences in his development ( painting & writing ) and condensing several important people into one person , for the sake of telling a coherent , believable story , not burdened by small , distracting , less important actualities . ( See Christy Brown in Wikipedia for more accuracy . ) The DVD version we were shown had some English subtitles that were a great help in understanding Christy 's speech ( & some of the Irish speech ) ; the initial release of the film may have lacked this . ( If you see this on DVD , enable that option . ) The performance by Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the greatest , believable acting jobs I 've ever seen . Truly magnificent , outstanding , superlative . " My Left Foot " bears more than some similarity to a more recent film , " The Diving Bell & the Butterfly , " in that each portrays the life of a real person successfully surmounting the imprisonment and isolation of an extremely severe physical handicap . And in doing so , it resonates with William Ernest Henley 's " Invictus " which begins : " Out of the night that covers me , / Black as the Pit from pole to pole , / I thank whatever gods may be / For my unconquerable soul . "  
  I have seen this film three times now , and each time I see it , it becomes more personal and more emotional to watch . The acting is amazing , which is not hard to believe since it is Daniel Day Lewis , who is an amazing actor . Brenda Fricker is the surprise wonder in it , though . She captures your heart as the mother of a physically disabled boy , who is not able to walk , or speak until he is in his late teens . I can't say enough good things about the movie , but I will stop here . I recommend it to anyone who enjoys movies that are based on actual events , or just enjoy good dramas in general .  
  Seriously , can you imagine such a spread of talent in one film without a huge budget : Daniel Day-Lewis , Ray McAnally , Brenda Fricker , Hugh O'Conor AND Fiona Shaw ? There 's no doubting that Fricker and Day-Lewis deserved their awards : but it would have been entirely justifiable to have seen O'Conor ( as Young Christie ) and McAnally awarded : the cliché is true here : they don't perform the roles , they inhabit them . Day-Lewis ' performance is a tour de force - such a transformation that it is awe-inducing , but it was truly a mark of the Academy 's intelligence that alongside this performance , they also honoured Brenda Fricker 's beautifully restrained , still and heart-wrenching work as Christie 's mother . By the way , if you haven't seen this magnificent actress in " Swann " , that 's another film well worth checking out for her contribution ( and the sublime Miranda Richardson ) .  
  My wife , Kate and I absolutely loved the series and can't wait for the next one ( hopefully there is a sequel ! ) . I would love to know what the catchy song is called and who wrote it , maybe because I am " old and grey " and still interested in life : - ) . If anyone has the full lyrics please send them . Of course one big reason why my wife and I liked this series so much was that we are 75 years old and retired but still very active intellectually . It 's great to see a show that highlights the contribution to society that can still be made by older people with special skills and experience . The human interest aspect showing the interactions of the characters and the younger people around them is an important part of the show . This series is highly entertaining and very sophisticated , on a par with some of our other favourites , " Spooks " and " Hustle " .  
  Police Story is a stunning series of set pieces for Jackie Chan to show his unique talents and bravery . Some of the stunts here are among Jackie 's best and most dangerous the whole mall fight finale is probably Jackie 's greatest single fight sequence , more brutal and less comedic then say Project A or Drunken Master at the end of the fight you can almost feel the pain of the impact . But unfortunately the rest of the film doesn't hold up to this quality as it is a rather formulaic cop thriller with some comedy elements . I always prefer JC in films such as Project A where his natural comic talents shine through . In the serious confines of some elements of Police Story it just doesn't work for me . Having said that though this is still up there with Jackies best films due to the incredible stunt work and sheer spectacle . As usual with Hong Kong films avoid the English dubbed DVD version as it is truly awful stick with the subtitles . Great stunts , OK movie a fine starting point if you 've not seen a JC movie before and well worth a watch for any movie fan 7/10  
  Probably Jackie Chan 's best film in the 1980s , and the one that put him on the map . The scale of this self-directed police drama is evident from the opening and closing scenes , during which a squatters ' village and shopping mall are demolished . There are , clearly , differences between the original Chinese and dubbed English versions , with many of the jokes failing to make their way into the latter . The latter is also hampered by stars who sound nothing like their Chinese originals . In fact , the only thing the dubbing has corrected is the court trialat the time , trials in colonial Hong Kong were conducted in English , while the original has this scene in Cantonese ! Nonetheless , Chan 's fighting style and the martial arts choreography inject humour where possible , so non-Cantonese audiences don't miss much . It 's not , after all , the dialogue that makes a Chan flick , but the action and the painful out-takes . The story is easy to follow : Chan plays an incorruptible Hong Kong detective pursuing a gangland godfather ( Cho Yeun ) , and assigned to protect a star witness ( Brigitte Lin ) . The action is superb from beginning to end , and there 's not much time to breathe in between . It 'll never get you thinking , but what an entertaining , and well strung-together , film . Arguably , this is one of the best martial arts films out there .  
  Since the advent of literature , people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love . Even more fascinating have always been the tales of impossible love , love that cannot be . The Israeli filmmaker Eytan Fox ' latest film The Bubble " is about that . And then it is also not . The title of the film refers to the bubble " that is Tel-Aviv set against the background of the political realities of Israel . The country 's cosmopolitan and unofficial capital city doesn't have much in common with Nablus , a city in the Palestinian West Bank which also features in the film . It doesn't have much in common with the tense and hateful atmosphere at the Palestinian checkpoints . Actually , it doesn't seem to have much in common with anything surrounding it . The bubble " of Tel-Aviv allows people to have a lifestyle which isn't much different from what you may expect in any Western city . Teenage girls looking for Britney Spears ' records , a lifestyle magazine editor looking for a sexy cover for his next issue , trendy people sitting in trendy cafes discussing trendy things over cups of cappuccino and other similarly trendy drinks , while those at home are watching the local edition of Pop Idol . It is this bubble " that also has the potential to lull one 's mind into a false sense of reality . The film evolves around the lives of three young Israelis who share a flat and , for the most part , try to stay out of politics . Yelli , the camp owner and manager of Orna & Ella " , a hip cafe , rarely leaves the city and prefers not to think about the crap that surrounds them " . Noam , a soft and easygoing employee of a slightly avantguard record store , seems to be equally unwilling to engage in long political discussions and contemplations . Lulu , the only female of the lot , is on the contrary linked to the Israeli Left , although her political activities seem to be confined to raves against the occupation " . Yelli and Noam naturally don't object to participating in these . Lulu and her political friends make t-shirts with the rave 's logo , put up posters and hand out booklets advertising it in the neighbourhood . Their main concern seems to be that there are never any actual Palestinians participating and that the police might come and spoil all the fun for them again . The closest they come to an actual confrontation is when they get into a scuffle with some not so Palestinian-friendly locals who try to prevent them from handing out the leaflets . In other words , predictable products of the bubble " . The opening scenes of the film take us to a checkpoint on a road to Nablus where we also find Noam doing his reserve duty . A group of Palestinians is being thoroughly checked before entering Israel , among them a pregnant woman who suddenly goes into labour and gives birth to a stillborn child despite the best efforts from Noam and the doctor who eventually arrives in an ambulance . The woman is comforted by a young man who later turns up on Noam 's doorstep in Tel-Aviv with his ID which the latter obviously dropped during the ordeal on the border . His name is Ashraf , he 's Palestinian and he 's gay . And he hasn't just come to hand back the ID , he has come to see Noam . Without a permit to live in Israel and despite the initial hesitation from Noam 's flatmates he stays . He soon gets a Jewish name and a job at Yelli 's cafe . Having grown up in Jerusalem with Hebrew , he doesn't have an Arabic accent which makes it possible for him and his newly found friends to conceal his identity . The sky is light blue and the air is sweet . But it cannot last . For he has become part of an equation which was never meant to be . At one point , Noam and Ashraf watch a play called Bent about two prisoners in a Nazi concentration camp who have a love relationship which can never become physical or visible to the surrounding guards . They find a way of being together on another level , a metaphysical one , a level where no one else has access . This is also where our couple arrives in the end . And it couldn't have been much different for them , not in today 's Israel . The Bubble " is a political statement about the bubble that bursts when confronted with the political realities of today 's Israel set against the background of a beautiful and awkward love story involving an Israeli and a Palestinian , the impossible love story in a divided world where no such things as compromise or other colours than black and white exist . The Bubble " is also a beautiful film about people , gay and straight , inhabiting that strange city , Tel-Aviv , shown through the eyes of people who really care about them . The film 's premise may have its flaws and the fatal chain of events may seem somewhat construed , but its strong message and emotional impact will not leave you untouched .  
  The reviewer who called this movie a bust has clearly missed the point . It 's obvious he hasn't been young or innocent in a very long time , or he might have understood that the tragedy of it was that the well-meaning young characters actually thought they COULD make a difference by putting up posters and holding a rave for peace . If only it was that easy . But the cynics sit and sneer at people who earnestly try their best to make things better , as the situation gets worse and worse every single day . Well , if you 're not part of the solution , you 're part of the problem . The central theme is that revenge begets more revenge , which begets even more , in an ever-expanding bloodbath . Both sides will tell you tales of atrocities committed by the other side , which they think justify their committing even MORE in retaliation . Where does it end ? And apparently he missed the significance of " the bubble " referred to in the name , which was that people living in Tel Aviv are strangely cut off from the ugly realities of what is going on all around them , which is partly why they seemed so naive . ( He also seemed to think that Ashraf could slip through the checkpoints without a problem , which tells me he wasn't paying attention when Ashraf related the delays and problems he had encountered . ) I found it very brave of the director , the screenplay writer , and both star-crossed lovers , to update the Romeo & Juliet story to a modern troubled land , and to make both lovers male . Let 's be honest here : Very few people would have a problem if one of them had been a female ( young love wins all hearts ) - but when people 's uneasiness with their sexuality is added to the fact that , incredibly , these same people would rather have them HATE each other , then the conclusion is inevitable .  
  Despite the lack of logic present in the storyline , Kill Shot is a highly enjoyable film . Through a moving performance Kasper Van Dien brilliantly portrays the emotional rift between a hard working wealthy father and his misguided son . Each member of the supporting cast pitches in with a solid performance , highlighted by the vivid acting of a young asian man whose name I cannot recall . A shockingly tragic ending may unnerve some younger viewers , but as a whole Kill Shot truly delivers a death blow .  
  Anyone who had never seen anything like the fight scenes in The Matrix has never seen this movie . The fight scenes were choreographed by action scene psychopath Yuen Woo Ping , who also did the fights in The Matrix . And the fight scenes are somethin . Li plays a supersoldier who feels no pain , who now lives a life as a pacifist librarian ( ya got me ) . When other evil supersoldiers begin killing off local drug lords to take over the drug trade , Li teams up with his cop buddy to help stop them . There are some absolutely crazy things going on in this movie ( one badguy gets his arm lopped off with a pane of glass and hardly notices ) . The fights scenes are filled with flying kicks and punches ; the body count is way up there . Li has seldom been better , and he has surrounded himself with a bevy of beautiful female costars ( Yip kicks some serious ass as a fellow supersoldier ) . Anthony Wong even makes a cameo as a drug lord ( no suprises there ; he makes a cameo in every HK movie ) . It 's unfortunate they don't make action movies like this in the US ; I wouldn't have to sit through all of these horrible dubbing jobs to see that action that I crave so much . Recommended .  
  This is one of the more adorable episodes of the Twilight Zone , with some fun dialog and amusing characters to break the tension of some creepy moments . There 's the usual blond vamp " dancer " ( what is up with Serling 's fondness for that kind of character , such that she keeps showing up in various episodes ? ) and other assorted characters , but it 's Jack Elam 's " old man " who totally steals the show . I consider this the funny , light-hearted version of " The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street " - or , perhaps , a 20-minute Twilight Zone parody of " The Thing . " On another note : I thought the young lover of the episode might be someone who eventually went on to other things - he looked familiar - but it seems that " Ron Kipling " disappeared after just two TV credits to his name .  
  THE YOUNG VICTORIA is a elegantly costumed and reproduced bit of history that benefits from some fine settings , solid direction by Jean-Marc Vallée of stalwart Julian Fellowes ' version of the youthful lass who was to become England 's longest reigning monarch - Victoria . Much of the early portion of the film , that part when Victoria is a child whose ascent to the throne is contested by her mother ( Miranda Richardson ) and Sir John Conroy ( Mark Strong ) seems to drag and get lost in the multiple costumes and scenery variations . But once Victoria ( Emily Blunt ) comes of age and is courted by Prince Albert ( Rupert Friend ) the film blooms . Blunt is a strong actress and finds that delicate line between girlish infatuation and royal dignity that makes her a fine foil for those at court who would seek to control the ' child queen ' - including her secretary Lord Melbourne ( Paul Bettany ) . But as she matures into her role as queen her eye dwells on the dashing German Prince Albert , and a love affair that has lasted in the memories of everyone is matched by the concept of joining Royalty with concern for the care of her subjects - much due to the sensitivity of Albert . The film takes us to the birth of their first of nine children and then ends with some statements about the influence of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert 's effect on the various Royalties throughout Europe ! It makes for an evening of beautiful costume drama and allows us to appreciate the growth of two young stars in Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend . A solid if not transporting epic . Grady Harp  
  I was initially forced to attend by my wife as she is fascinated by the Royal families of Britain and their history , and she won't go to the cinema without me . Although viewers shouldn't expect to be electrified , this film is very well made and the visual aspect is second to none . In many ways it helps dispel the myth that Victoria was the miserable unsmiling dumpy woman usually seen in photographs . She was a bright intelligent and according to the history of her early years , a fun loving happy young woman . Her love of Albert was the essence of true love , and even if you only count the number of children she bore ( 9 ) , they must have had a passionate relationship . All of this is well borne out in the film . To this end , the cast has been well selected with both Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend giving sound performances as Victoria and Albert . ( SPOILER ALERT ) The historical accuracy is somewhat questionable as at no time did Prince Albert get shot while defending Victoria . There was at least one assassination attempt when they were out together , but nobody was struck by the shot / s . I also found it odd that little was done to expand on the allegedly intimate relationship between Victoria 's mother and Sir John Conroy . It is quite likely that this relationship was the true reason for Victoria 's distaste for both her mother and Conroy . I also found it odd that there was an attempt to portray the relationship between Victoria and Lord Melbourne as erring on the romantic , or at least having the potential to become romantic . He was already in his late 50 's when Victoria came to the throne , and while marriages between older men and young women were common in that era , the movie portrays Melbourne as being a dashing 30 something and rival to Prince Albert . There were apparently rivals to Albert , but she could never have married even slightly below her station in life , and Albert was one of only a handful who would have been acceptable in any case . All in all I have spent worse times at the cinema , and brownie points with my wife can't be a bad thing either .  
  a timeless classic , wonderfully acted with perfect location settings , conjuring a marvelous atmospheric movie . a simple story mingled with humor and suspense . i wish that a video was available in Britain . i have seen this film on many occasions and it remains one of my favorites along with Oh Mr Porter .  
  The Ghost Train is a treat to those who appreciate the typical 1940 's humour . It incorporates World War Two into the plot but not as much as I initially believed it would , and the characters are a unique blend who play their roles fairly well . Askey , playing the role of Tommy Gander , is what brightens the story up for the parts which could of been portrayed as boring or " dragging " . The story of the haunted station is actually spooky even for present day standards . It is unique and the way the characters communicate with each is fantastic to liven up the mystery which is The Ghost Train . Gander is basically a nuisance to all the other members while the rest get along fairly well . He is always centre of attention and can be dubbed as being " annoying " but that is by those who do not appreciate 1940 's humour . His humour is innocent and childish which makes it sweet to watch . If it was not for Askey / Gander , than this film would of been shorter in action , enjoyment and the result would be not as effective in my opinion .  
  The Last of the Blond Bombshells is an entertaining bit of fluff . Judy Dench plays Elizabeth , a newly widowed woman at loose ends . She has spent most of her life being the dutiful wife and mother but has never been truly happy . Shortly after her husband 's funeral , Elizabeth is having her regular lunch date with her stick in the mud children when she spots a street performer . This sparks memories of when she was a member of an all girl swing band in London during World War II . We soon learn that the band was not exactly all girl as the drummer was a man dressing as a woman ala Some Like It Hot . Elizabeth pulls out her sax ( which she has been secretly practicing throughout her marriage ) and joins forces with the guitar-playing street musician . Elizabeth is far more talented than the guitarist , and the money begins to flow in . She doesn't take any money as she is wealthy and doesn't need it . Her playing is strictly for artistic fulfillment . Elizabeth is seen one day by Patrick ( Ian Holm ) who was the drummer-in-drag of the band . It seems that Patrick was - and still is - quite the ladies ' man , and Elizabeth - being only fifteen at the time - was the only band member who did not experience Patrick 's " talents " other than drumming . Elizabeth is inspired by her granddaughter to get the old group together once again to play for the granddaughter 's school dance . Thus begins a delightful trip down memory lane combined with aspects of a humorous road trip movie - all topped off with some really good swing and blues . I guess I 'm at the age in which I really enjoy older actresses doing their stuff , and this film is a treasure trove as it not only stars Judi Dench , but she is supported by none less than Olympia Dukakis , Leslie Caron , and a host of seasoned British character actresses . This is all topped off by the extraordinary voice of Cleo Laine . Yes , it is fluff , but totally delightful and exceedingly entertaining fluff .  
  Refreshing ` lost ' gem ! Featuring effective dialog combined with excellent acting to establish the characters and involve you enough to care what happens to them . The Douglas and Widmark characters are realistic heroes . Palance is his usual evil presence . Widmark win the fisticuffs fight scene , a car chase of less than 60 seconds with a ` logical ' end , and a lengthy chase on foot that shames the overdone chase sequences of contemporary Hollywood . You know how it will likely end , but the suspense and interest are sustained throughout . The end of the chase is one of the most realistic you will ever see . The film seems to slow a little past the middle , but stay with it for the rewarding conclusion .  
  This movie is not great , but it is a good and enjoyable one . It feels like an indie film made out of a play script . Morgan Freeman basically plays himself , although the director swears the script was not written for him . And there is the small irony of the actor that goes in a supermarket to do research for a film that he hasn't committed to yet . I mean , he actually made the film in the end and we are watching it : ) I found the dialogue a bit too positive for my taste , but refreshing nonetheless . This is a film that inspires the viewer to take a look at their own lives and choose the direction in which to go . A bit too much emphasis on appearance , if you ask me . Bottom line : a nice little film , made in two weeks , with basically two actors and a few extras , dialogue driven , makes Morgan Freeman look good : )  
  Leave it to Braik to put on a good show . Finally he and Zorak are living their own lives outside of Spac Ghost Coast To Coast . I have to say that I love both of these shows a whole lot . They are completely what started Adult Swim . Brak made it big with an album that came out in the year 2000 . It may not have been platinum , but his show was really popular to tons of people out there that love Adult Swims shows . I have to say that out of all the Adult Swim shows with no plot , this has to be the one with the most none plot ever made . That is why I like it so much , it is just such a classic in the Adult Swim history . I believe this is just such a great show , if you don't like it . Hey there were tons who hated it and tons who loved it .  
  This is the second Baby Burlesk short to be released , and probably the most popular one , is a spoof of the 1926 silent film What Price Glory . I watched this and I do not understand the kiddie-porn that is being claimed . It is just a cute little film . I have seen family shows that I grew up watching in the ' 80 's and ' 90 's that had little girls dressed more provocatively acting in a ' mature manner ' . It was more provocative because they WEREN'T dressed in diapers . There 's nothing provocative about a diaper unless you have one of those fetishes . ( just a joke ) I read that description of the movie and where it states only a pedophile would enjoy watching this . That is sick . To me , if you watch this and are bothered by it , then maybe you need to look into your own psyche and try to figure out why it bothers you . It is an innocent film that was made as a parody of another film . All of the B.B. films were parodies , nothing more . The parodies / spoofs of today are graphic in nature and have true almost pornographic scenes and quite vile language . Shouldn't those be more appalling ? I can watch those without issue , but they sometimes take children 's stories and turn them into filth on those parodies . That is what should get under your skin . Not that they babified ( not a word , I know ) an adult movie from 1926 , because we know how PORNOGRAPHIC those silent films were , huh ? Not to mention those ' Forbidden Hollywood Pre-Code era films ' so vile and filthy . They would NEVER make such filth today ? ( note the sarcasm )  
  It 's a shame this movie is so hard to get your hands on in the US . I found it through a rare video dealer , and it was certainly worth it . This is , without a doubt , the best film made during the pre-code era , and the finest film of the 1930s . Masterful director Frank Borzage made wonderful films about the Depression , and with MAN 'S CASTLE he created a fairy tale amidst the hardships of the era . Loretta Young and Spencer Tracy have a wonderful chemistry between them , and they help make this movie a wonderful romance . Young 's Trina is sweet and hopeful , while Tracy 's Bill is gruff and closed-off . The dynamic between the character creates one of the most difficult , but in the end rewarding relationships on film . MAN 'S CASTLE is the most soft-focus pre-code film I 've seen . Borzage uses the hazy and dreamy technique to turn the squatter 's village where Bill and Trina live into a palace . The hardships of the Depression are never ignored , in fact they 're integral to the film . But as Borzage crafts the film as a soft focus fairy tale , the love between the characters makes the situation seem less harsh . It makes the film warm and affectionate . MAN 'S CASTLE is the crowning achievement of the pre-code era . If only more people could see it .  
  Barbra Streisand 's first television special was simply fantastic ! From her skit as a child to her medley of songs in a high-fashion department store - everything was top-notch ! It was easy to understand how this special received awards . Not muddled down by guest appearances , the focus remained on Barbra thoughout the entire production .  
  I rented this movie and watched it 20 times before I took it back to the store . Bill Paxton hired some first rate talent to make a good thriller with some interesting twists . The story is original and well written . Powers Booth and Paxton both deliver good performances . The story is told in an interesting manner with both flashbacks 20 years back , then spots in the present , alternating back and forth . This style of storytelling makes for a good thriller that can't get dull . Bill Paxton , please make more horror movies , you have the talent for it !  
  All in all a good film and better for the fact that had the film not been made the story might remain hidden to the masses . Brosnan does a good job as the native American with a hidden past and the photography is stunning . To some , this may be too whimsical , to others boring - for me it is a gentle , well-told tale and perfect for family viewing . Now that 's not something you get a lot of recently .  
  This movie was terrific and even with a less than convincing ending , it 's still well worth seeing . The film begins as Claudette Colbert is about to marry Robert Ryan . When the minister asks if anyone has any objections , a guy jumps up and announces that Colbert CAN'T get married because she already is married ! Colbert insists this isn't true , but when they investigate they find that the Justice of the Peace and many others remember her wedding and there is even a signed wedding license ! Slowly , it becomes apparent that Claudette 's mind is slipping and people around her seriously doubt her sanity . Then , when the supposed first husband is murdered , all evidence and suspicion falls on Colbert . The film is an exciting mystery suspense film , as what I have so far described is only the first half of the movie . What follows is amazingly intelligent and captivating . Unfortunately , the conclusion , though , is a bit of a let-down , as the guiding force behind all this turns out to come " right out of left field " - and is baffling since it was so unexpected and impossible to guess based on the information given to the viewer . However , in spite of this , the film was so good , I can even excuse the limp ending . In particular , Robert Ryan did a great job as the " knuckle-busting " fiancé , though apart from him the other performances were also excellent .  
  Even longtime Shirley fans may be surprised by " Now and Forever . " The movie was filmed with Paramount studios  not with Shirley 's parent company Twentieth Century Fox  in 1934 , before Fox producer Darryl Zanuck had perfected the successful Shirley formula ( cute songs , cold hearts for her to melt , young couples for her to play cupid to , happy endings ) . Thus " Now and Forever " falls into the category of a Shirley vehicle without the standard Shirley story . It is an awkward position for any movie , but this impressive , talented cast makes it work . Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard star as fun-loving , irresponsible con artists Jerry and Toni Day . The only thing that this devoted yet dysfunctional duo seems to hate more than being together is being apart . When they are suddenly landed with custody of Jerry 's young daughter Penny ( Shirley Temple ) , it is Toni  and not Penny , as many believe  who persuades Jerry to give up his criminal career . But Jerry flounders at his desk job , and desperate to prove that he can provide for his new family , he soon returns to thieving and dishonesty . In a standard Shirley device , Penny tries to melt the heart of crusty curmudgeon Felix Evans , the victim of one of Jerry 's cons , but her attempt fails , for Evans is revealed to be a con artist himself , and he blackmails Jerry into helping him steal jewels . The drama , gunfight , death , and sorrow that follow all make this film a very unusual one for Little Miss Sunshine . There is no happy ending , no dancing , and only one song sequence ( the cute number " The World Owes Me a Living " ) . But this does not mean that Shirley fans should avoid " Now and Forever . " Rather , it 's divergence from the usual Shirley story make it more interesting and memorable than many of her other films . But beware : You should avoid colorized version of this film , and see it in black-and-white if you can . The color is bright , garish , and unrealistic , and in many scenes , Shirley 's famous curls are actually red instead of blonde . Yikes !  
  First let me say I am not from the south but I am an American . I don't love Country music but I can stomach it . I would never wear a cowboy hat but I wear hats . I don't live in a trailer but I do eat tuna salad and own a home . What does that have to do with this comment ? A lot if you are one of those people who say only " country " people love this movie . This movie is loosely based on the " They loved and lost " premise . James Bridges directs an American love story as real as it gets . In an era of Jerry Springer and " Lets put it out there " mentality , this film rings truer than ever . Bud is " coming of age " and embarks on a life of his own with a little help from his aunt and uncle so he moves to the big city with them . Bud finds himself drawn into the local honky tonk world for the only escape a blue collar man can afford . He quickly meets Sissy who is from a similar background and the two have a whirlwind romance filled with painful ups and downs . ( * This plot takes so many turns that one has to just sit for a few minutes before they get hooked . Marriage is a focus here that is often missed . Early in the film they marry and we view the transition from being single to married . The film highlights some of the modern struggles a woman has when she marries an old fashioned man . It also brings into view the male ego with women and competition . ) Bud is challenged and is excited when Micky 's puts in an electronic bull . Sissy gets ideas of having fun on it too but is quickly reminded that she is married and need to start " acting like it . " The emotion between the two characters is raw and expressive and the plot continues from there especially when they ( NOTE THIS IS GIVING SOME OF THE STORYLINE AWAY ) split and Sissy falls for an ex con with a penchant for abuse and cruelty . She soon realizes that the grass is not always greener on the other side . How anyone can compare Bud to Vinnie Barbirino is shocking to me . John Travolta gave an exceptional performance that was worthy recognition . He was believable and real . The scene where he shaves his beard and you first see him at the bar .. still gives me goosebumps . Mind you I am not a huge Travolta fan , but come on , I see why Sissy was kicking of her boots so early in the film . Deb Winger was so real that you found yourself sympathizing with her as she pens a note of emotions to Bud , after sneaking in to clean his house during their break up . The supporting cast was incredible . Wes played by Scott Glenn gave a first rate performance that made you hate him and curse him as he abused Sissy . Madolyn Smith-Osborne , as Buds Mistress / girlfriend was so authentic that large chested girls across the U.S. prayed to wake up flat chested to wear the clothes she donned in the film . My biggest kudos 's go to Barry Corbin and Brooke Anderson as Bud 's aunt and uncle . They seemed like someone 's aunt and uncle somewhere in Texas and however small their role , they made the film so much bigger and lifelike . Two memorable scenes were the Dolly Parton contest and the unforgettable scene where Bud and his aunt stand outside after one of the characters death . The dialog between them is touching . If you can watch this for what it is , a true American love story . Then I recommend that you take it for what it is .. a film before it 's time that gave us voyeurism into a world unlike our own but real enough for our enjoyment and entertainment . If this world sounds similar to yours then you will enjoy it so much more . Lastly , the music however dated , is sure to send you back in time if you are over 30 years of age .  
  I saw the last five or ten minutes of this film back in 1998 or 1999 one night when I was channel-surfing before going to bed , and really liked what I saw . Since then I 've been on the lookout , scouring TV listings , flipping through DVD / VHS racks at stores , but didn't find a copy until recently when I found out some Internet stores sold it . Then , being a world-class procrastinator , I still didn't order it . Finally , I found a DVD copy in a Circuit City while visiting Portland , OR , a few weeks ago . Then it only took me about a month after returning home before sitting down and watching it . So , what do I think about the film ? It 's good . Not as good as I remembered and hoped for , but still well worth the $ 9.99 it cost me . After seeing the whole film for the first time I rate it as a 7/10 , with potential to become an 8/10 . I 'll have to be less sleepy then , and have a better sound system to avoid rewinding to catch some dialogue .  
  " The Ladies Man " suffers a common problem among movies based on " Saturday Night Live " skits . And that is , a sketch that usually succeeds in five minutes will not do so well in ninety minutes . Although this movie does have its laughs , like Tim Meadows as Leon Phelps , a sex-maniac straight out of the ' 70s , and Will Ferrell as a wrestling-obsessed husband cuckolded by Leon . So this movie is funny enough , but it 's no " Wayne 's World " !  
  Clearly an hilarious movie . It angers me to see the poor ratings given to this piece of comic genius Please look at this for what it is , a funny , ridiculous enjoyable film . Laugh for christ sake !  
  I can remember watching this for the first time , when I was 9 years old . I wanted to be one of the " barbarian brothers " . This movie is still great . One original aspect was that the fight scenes where very short . Implying that the " barbarian brothers " where so good that they finished there enemies off quickly ! Plus , you have chases , a cage fight , a dragon , and yes even a bar brawl ! Yes , the acting is bad so that 's why it 's not a ten , also the story line has received a lot of criticism . I think it is quite original . Not to many movies in it 's genre have the same original story lines , or colorful dialogue . I definitely recommend this film .  
  Another Spanish movie about the 1936 Civil War . This time we 're told about the story of Carol ( lovely played by débutant Clara Lago ) , a little girl which comes to live to a little Spanish village from New York . It is such an initiating trip , and soon she 'll find about the injustices of the human race , their stupid fights and conflicts , their contradictions . Imanol Uribe makes his best film since " Días Contados " ( 1994 ) with such a sober pulse , a beautiful photography , and a nice script . He tries not to take part in the conflict , he just shows us some facts and let us decide ( ok , the facts are explicit enough to make us decide in which band are we in ) and he takes a huge advantage of the presence and the freshness of the young starring couple : Clara Lago and Juan José Ballesta . A well cared production . My rate : 7/10  
  If you were brought up on a diet of gameshows you 'll understand that you gradually need a bigger and better fix . Well , in the world of the Running Man , your needs will be sated . For in this game show , prisoners compete for freedom , and the ultimate prize - their very lives . I loved this film . It was such a parody on the mind-numbing tripe that we watch on a daily basis . It isn't one of Schwarzenegger 's best performances , but on the whole it is a very good film . The underlying idea that Television Corporations will one day be the " real " rulers of the planet is very believable , and is very well portrayed in this film . Of course there are the usual Arnie one-liners , my favourite is when he is about to be catapulted into the gamezone , the gameshow host asks " Any last words ? " Arnie says : " Yeah , I 'll be back " but the host quips " Only in a re-run " and presses the eject button . I give this film a 10 for sheer originality . I must have watched it 30 or more times . The only film apart from the Die Hard series that I watched this often ! In short , do not for a minute think that you own the T.V. - It owns you ..  
  After watching the Next Action Star reality TV series , I was pleased to see the winners ' movie right away . I was leery of such a showcase of new talent , but I was pleasantly surprised and thrilled . Billy Zane , of course , was his usual great self , but Corinne and Sean held their own beside him . It was also nice to see Jared and Jeanne ( also from the competition ) in their cameo roles . Sean 's character , not Billy 's , is the hunted , and his frustration at discovering new rules in the game is well played . Corinne walks the tightrope well between her character liking Sean 's and only being in it for the money . I loved how the game was played right to the last second . And then beyond ! Not a great movie , but an entertaining one all the way and a great showcase for two folks on their first time out of the gate .  
  This movie is a brilliant lesson on Japanese history set in at the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate shortly before the Shogunate lost a big battle against the loyalist , who wanted the emperor back on the throne to rule Japan . Really , I had to read a lot of history to get the entire background . Shintaro Katsu ( also known as the original Zatoichi ) gives a superb performance as Izo Okada , one of the four Hitokiri ( = Human Slayer ) of the Bakumatsu . He is a simple samurai who looses all of his wealth . In order to have a good life he becomes a retainer of Takechi Hanpei ( played by Tatsuya Nakada = Ryonosuke out of Sword of Doom ) . Hanpei is a ultra-nationalist politician who lets his band of Hitokiri assassinate a lot of high ranking pro-west politicians in order to achieve his political goals . Izo Okada follows his leader without really questioning what they are doing . As long as he has money to go and drink and spend at his whore . Okada 's killings get more and more brutal in the course of the movie and he is proud to have a reputation based on fear wherever he goes . It is a splendid portrait on the life of a simple samurai who gets caught up in political affairs and is really to naive to realize what is happening . First after being betrayed and tortured and always having talks with Sakamoto ( who is a samurai who rejects violence ) does he change his ideas and views on life . But too late .. Watch the movie to see the end of Izo Okada .. Shintaro Katsu and the rest of the staff give a brilliant performance . Each actor reaches up to their role . The sword-fights a very unique and fast .. probably faster than several movies nowadays .. Check it out if you have the chance !  
  Hitokiri ( which translates roughly as " assassination " ) , a / k / a " Tenchu " which translates roughly as " divine punishment " ) showcases Hideo Gosha at the top of his form . Do NOT miss this one , or Gosha 's other classic , Goyokin ! Hitokiri is not only one of Gosha 's best films , it 's one of the best " samurai / chambara " films ever made , and perhaps one of the best Japanese films ever exported . Be warned , all of the intricate plot details in Hitokiri can be a little hard to follow for those unfamiliar with 19th century Japanese history . Even so , the underlying human drama is obvious and open to all viewers . As per the norm for Gosha , Hitokiri provides yet another variation on his traditional theme of " loyalty to one 's lord " vs . " doing the right thing " . However , Gosha develops his favorite theme with such sophistication , that it 's really _ the _ movie to see ( along with Goyokin , of course ) . I suppose it breaks down like this : If you want a simpler , more action-oriented tale , you might want to see Goyokin . However , if you want a more thoughtful , multilayered ( albeit grim ) drama , see this one . ( OK , OK , essentially , the historical backdrop is a massive power grap between many different samurai clans who are either ( 1 ) working to reform , yet retain , the Tokugawa Shogunate , and ( 2 ) those who are trying to install the Emperor Meiji as the supreme ruler of Japan . Of course , those clans working " for " Emperor Meiji were often less interested in " reforming " Japan than in ensuring their own clan more power in the " new world order " . Ironically , the entire feudal system was officially abolished as one of the first reforms of the Meiji government . It 's ironic twists like this - Gosha 's big on irony - that make the entire plot all the more bittersweet . ) What distinguishes " Hitokiri " from Gosha 's other movies is Gosha 's mature sense of cinematography . Every shot is thoughtfully composed , and ( much like Kubrick 's Barry Lyndon ) each frame of the movie could hold its own as a still composition . Of course , this is typical Gosha . Hitokiri really stands out with stunning backdrops , including ( as with Goyokin ) many riveting seascapes . Just watch the opening sequence , and you 're hooked ! Make no mistake , this is no English period piece : Hitokiri is extremely violent ( don't say you weren't warned ) . What else , other than cool camera work , makes Hitokiri stand out ? The performances seem ( to me ) a bit more subtle in this one . Katsu Shintaro ( of Zatoichi / Hanzo the Razor fame ) turns in a star performance as the conflicted protagonist / antihero , Okada Izo . Katsu manages to instill humanity to a character that seems almost more wild animal than villain . Throughout the movie , you 're never quite sure if you 're engaged or revolted by Okada 's character . At the same time , Katsu 's portrayal of Okada 's ravenous hunger for respect , and his later pathetic attempts at redemption , seem so human that you can't help but feel empathy / sympathy . Of course , after seeing Nakadai Tatsuya play the tortured hero in " Goyokin " , it 's great to see him play such a ruthless villain in " Hitokiri " . He 's just perfect , there 's nothing more to say ! As a final note , perhaps more interesting to buffs than to casual fans , don't miss the last screen appearance of Mishima Yukio ( yes , the closeted gay right-wing ultranationalist novelist who committed suicide by seppuku before the crowd of jeering Japanese military personnel he " kidnapped " in 1970 , and had a movie on his life and work made by Paul Schrader ) , who actually does a pretty solid job of portraying the honorable ( for an assassin ) Shinbei Tanaka .  
  Another Pokemon movie has hit the theaters , and again , I 'm hearing the same old , " Pokemon is dead , blah blah blah . " The franchise 's detractors couldn't be more wrong . Kids are still playing the trading card game , they 're still watching the TV series , they 're waiting for the Game Boy Advance games , and they want to see " Pokemon the 4th Movie . " That said , " Pokemon The 4th Movie " introduces us to two more " legendary " Pokemon : Suicune , the " north wind " of lore , and Celebi , guardian of the forest ( and star of the show ) . Celebi transports itself and a boy named Sam 40 years into the future , to the present day , where Pokemon trainer Ash , his faithful Pikachu , and his friends Brock and Misty are traveling through Johto . Sam and Ash become fast friends , once they discover the other 's mutual love for Pokemon ( Sam 's vintage Pokeball with screw-on top is a great moment ) . Together , they decide to protect Celebi from the villain of the story , the Team Rocket agent aptly named Vicious , who is hell-bent on capturing Celebi for his own ends . Will Ash and Sam be able to protect Celebi from Vicious ' Dark Balls ? Where does Suicune fit into the picture ? Will Jessie , James , and Meowth have bigger parts in this movie than before ? And just who is Sam , really ? Like with the first 3 movies , if you go into the movie deciding that you 're automatically going to hate it no matter what simply because it 's Pokemon ( or just because your child / niece / nephew / younger sibling / et cetera " dragged " you into it ) , then you 're going to hate it because you 've decided that you want to hate it . That may be , but to blindly trash " Pokemon The 4th Movie " simply because it is a Pokemon movie , and especially without having seen it , is just plain stupid . Even non-fans can enjoy this movie without having to know every last detail of the world of Pokemon . I 'm not saying that you WILL become a Pokemon fan because of this movie , but you CAN indeed enjoy it , if you 'll let yourself . Unlike the first 3 Pokemon movies , " Pokemon the 4th Movie " is being distributed by Miramax , who I 've heard is also working on securing the rights to the 5th Pokemon movie , which was released this past summer in Japan . Miramax claims to have some boffo-aggressive marketing strategy for " Pokemon The 4th Movie , " but all I 've seen so far is a feeble limited release , which doesn't include the usual Pikachu short in the beginning , which I was really looking forward to this time . I hope that Miramax will see fit to put the Pikachu short , called " Pikachu 's Exciting Hide-and-Seek , " onto at least the DVD / VHS release , if not with a future wider release of " Pokemon The 4th Movie . " I hope that the current release is just the tip of the iceberg for this very entertaining film .  
  Barbara Stanwyck plays Lily Powers . She 's a waitress for her father 's speakeasy in a little crummy mining town . He also sells her to men . She escapes to New York and literally sleeps her way to the top . Originally I had only seen the 71 minute version but it 's pretty extreme-for its time . Nowadays it 's pretty tame . The movie moves very quickly and has tons of sexual innuendo-some of it comes off as pretty silly ( but fun ) today . It moves so quickly you can easily ignore that most of it could never happen-even in 1933 . There 's nothing classic or monumental about this-it 's just a quick , gleefully dirty little film that 's lots of fun . It only falls apart at the end with a little " moral " ending that the censors demanded . It comes across as unbelievable and stupid ( I saw it in a theatre and the audience laughed at it-one guy quite rightfully said " No way " ) I just saw the uncut 75 minute version which has a different , somewhat tragic and MUCH better ending . This version was thought to be lost until 2004 when it was discovered by mistake ! I believe this is the only one in release-but be aware . The acting is good-Stanwyck jumps into her role and plays it WAY over the top . She makes you believe that she enjoys being cruel and sleeping around . There are also strong supporting performances from handsome Donald Cook and George Brent . Also look for a pre-stardom John Wayne in a hilarious bit as a meek and mild office worker ! Fun , dirty and fast . I give this a 9 .  
  This film is one of the more risqué black and white films of this time in the early 1930 's before the Hoyts Code was enforced . It 's the story of a young beautiful woman moving to New York and making her way to the top of the business by using her body as a tool to get there . Barbara Stanwyck plays the young and beautiful Lily Powers who indeed does a fairly well job with her performance . Lily moves to New York and makes her way up the business place by sleeping with all the men . Stanwyck does an outstanding performance as being a strong woman who uses men as one time deals , hardly any emotion towards them playing them as if they were pawns . Lily Powers is a woman who doesn't have love on her mind just power and money . I thought this movie to be a little bit different then other films I have seen because there is hardly any background music heard . I believe it is only because this is when people were first introduced to live sound and dialogue between the people of the film . The few times the music is heard is during the beginning as we are shown how she makes her way up the chain . The filming and different scenes were something fantastic ! The director of this film did all the right angles and all the right tricks , making this film full of realism . This film was all together an alright movie . The ending to this movie wasn't as good as it should have been , but it didn't entirely ruin it . Baby Face had its slow moving scenes throughout the movie , and perhaps a few predictable parts such as who she will sleep with next . But this is a lovable movie that can be watched more then once , and suggested to some people and friends .  
  Lily Powers works at a speakeasy until her father dies . She then goes to New York to work at an office building . There she notices that if she wants to get any higher she has to give the men what they want . And what men want is her .. well , you know . Alfred E.Green 's Baby Face ( 1933 ) is a movie of high sexual content . For a movie of that era , anyway . This was one of the last Pre-Code films that were made . Barbara Stanwyck gives a very sexy performance as Lily . Other actors of this film include George Brent ( Courtland Trenholm ) , Donald Cook ( Ned Stevens ) , Alphonse Ethier ( Adolf Cragg ) , Henry Kolker ( J.P.Carter ) , Margaret Lindsay ( Ann Carter ) and Theresa Harris ( Chico ) . The young John Wayne is seen as Jimmy McCoy Jr . This movie deals with a brave topic and it does it good . Baby Face is historically significant movie and therefore good to watch .  
  One of the most timely and engrossing documentaries , you 'll ever watch . While the story takes place in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas , it provides an intimate look into political dynamics , that prevail throughout the western Hemisphere . While essentially another chapter in the story of the " U.S. backed , Latin American coup " , this film chronicles in real-time , what can happen when the poorest people , are armed with unity , political savvy , and courage ! The political insights offered by this film are invaluable . One gets clear examples of the private media , as a formidable force for mass deception and propaganda . We see the poor people of Caracas grappling with the brutal realities of " American politics " . One gets a clear sense of impending doom , if the people fail to address the blatant tyranny , which has been abruptly , and illegally , thrust upon them by the conspirators . We also see the arrogance and fascism , of the CIA backed , private media , plutocrats , and generals , who 've conspired to bring Venezuela back under Washington 's domination . Though ably led by President Hugo Chavez , the people of Caracas are forced to act without him , after Chavez was forcibly kidnapped by renegade generals . Their response is the highpoint of the film . If one seeks an excellent portrait of what the U.S. government , Hugo Chavez , and revolutionary Venezuela , are all about , this movie is it !  
  I 'm going to review the 2 films as a whole because I feel that is how it should be considered , and watched . When I talk about ' the film ' I am talking about parts 1 & 2 together when watched one after the other , as they should be . Thank you Jon Anderson , Steven Soderbergh & Benicio Del Toro . This film is a refreshing , bold , gritty and true film . And , it hearkens a new style of film making . No Faux drama . No Swelling sound track . Not Faux Documentary style . Just clean shots and an attempt to stick to the facts . I have been reading Jon Anderson 's " Che Guevara : A Revolutionary Life " and recently finished Fidel 's Auto biography , and this had helped my ability to soak this film in properly . But I have to say that it is Jon Anderson 's exhaustive , penultimate and wonderful biography that has given this film the proper historical back bone . Anderson was consultant on this film ( or these 2 films ) . What makes this film a true thing is that it is clean . No swelling music or slow-motion photography to heighten drama , and even more importantly ; no fake documentary shaky camera . Just square shots and straight forward shooting style . The type of camera used makes you feel right there in the jungle . Benicio Del Toro should be given full honors for this , I never doubted him as Che throughout the film .. not once . He did a wonderful job and I will respect him for ever for this . Some people complain that the film only deals with 2 slices of his life and not the whole . But I think this is one of the true beautiful aspects of this film : it doesn't try to be everything . It doesn't try to ' tell the story ' . A person 's life is too multifaceted to try and tell in 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 or 32 hours . This is one of the subtle beauties of this film , it resists that temptation , and stays focused on the intent of letting us GET A FEEL FOR CHE , HIS DEVELOPING MILITARISTIC MIND AND THE FORCES AROUND HIM . It focuses on 3 slices of time : The Battle to over throw Batista , Che 's U.N. speech and the Gorilla preparations in Bolivia . " Motorcycle Diaries " already told his young man side , and I applaud S . Soderbergh for focusing on other aspects instead . I keep referring to Jon Anderson 's book and the film stays true . The only weak link for me are the casting ( not the performance ) of Matt Damon . In a film so loaded with true to life performances , an American , ( Matt Damon ) playing a Bolivian is a clunky stretch - he does well , but after so much care in the casting , this was an over-site . Small and completely forgiven . The reality that the rest of the casting gives you , and most notably Benicio Del Toro 's amazing job , put 's this film at the top of my list . The fact that this film went almost straight to video say 's something about how the cold war ethics that would never allow the ' revolutionized Cuba ' to become what it might have , are still at work keeping it 's story quiet . If not out of clandestine muffling , then out of the effects of properly done propaganda that has prejudiced this topic . This is a must see film , and Jon Anderson 's " Che Guevara : A Revolutionary Life " is a must read if you want to start to get a grasp of the early effects on the global mind set regarding the expansion of international / political financial chess moves of the 40 's , 50 's & 60 's that placed unfair pressure on our South American neighbors , and the effects it fostered .  
  I sat through both parts of Che last night , back to back with a brief bathroom break , and I can't recall when 4 hours last passed so quickly . I 'd had to psyche myself up for a week in advance because I have a real ' thing ' about directors , producers and editors who keep putting over blown , over long quasi epics in front of us and I feel that on the whole , 2 to 2.5 hours is about right for a movie . So 4 hours seemed to be stretching the limits of my tolerance and I was very dubious about the whole enterprise . But I will say upfront that this is a beautifully  I might say lovingly  made movie and I 'm really glad I saw it . Director Steven Soderbergh is to be congratulated on the clarity of his vision . The battle scenes zing as if you were dodging the bullets yourself . If there is a person on the planet who doesn't know , Ernesto ' Che ' Guevara was the Argentinian doctor who helped Fidel Castro overthrow Fulgencio Batista via the 1959 Cuban revolution . When I was a kid in the 1960s , Che 's image was everywhere ; on bedroom wall posters , on T shirts , on magazine covers . Che 's image has to be one of the most over exploited ever . If the famous images are to be relied on , then Che was a very good looking guy , the epitome of revolutionary romanticism . Had he been butt ugly , I have to wonder if he would have ever been quite so popular in the public imagination ? Of course dying young helps . Movies have been made about Che before ( notably the excellent Motorcycle Diaries of 2004 which starred the unbearably cute Gael Garcia Bernal as young Che , touring South America and seeing the endemic poverty which formed his Marxist politics ) but I don't think anyone has ever tackled the entire story from beginning to end , and this two-parter is an ambitious project . I hope it pays off for Soderbergh but I can only imagine that instant commercial success may not have been uppermost in his mind . The first movie ( The Agentine ) shows Che meeting Castro in Mexico and follows their journey to Cuba to start the revolution and then the journey to New York in 1964 to address the UN . Cleverly shot black and white images look like contemporary film but aren't . The second film ( Guerilla ) picks up again in 1966 when Che arrives in Bolivia to start a new revolutionary movement . The second movie takes place almost entirely in the forest . As far as I can see it was shot mostly in Spain but I can still believe it must have been quite grueling to film . Benicio Del Toro is excellent as Che , a part he seems born to play . Personally , I felt that The Argentine ( ie part one ) was much easier to watch and more ' entertaining ' in the strictly movie sense , because it is upbeat . They are winning ; the Revolution will succeed . Che is in his element leading a disparate band of peasants , workers and intellectuals in the revolutionary cause . The second part is much harder to watch because of the inevitability of his defeat . In much the same way that the recent Valkyrie - while being a good movie - was an exercise in witnessing heroic failure , so I felt the same about part two of Che ( Guerilla ) . We know at the outset that he dies , we know he fails . It is frustrating because the way the story is told , it is obvious fairly early on that the fomentation of revolution in Bolivia is doomed ; Che is regarded as a foreign intruder and fails to connect with the indigenous peoples in the way that he did with the Cubans . He doggedly persists which is frustrating to watch because I felt that he should have known when to give up and move on to other , perhaps more successful , enterprises . The movie does not romanticise him too much . He kills people , he executes , he struggles with his asthma and follows a lost cause long after he should have given up and moved on , he leaves a wife alone to bring up five fatherless children . But overall , an excellent exercise in classic movie making . One note ; as I watched the US trained Bolivian soldiers move in en masse to pick off Che and his small band of warriors one by one , it reminded me of the finale to Butch Cassidy . I almost turned to my husband and said so , but hesitated , thinking he would find such thoughts trite and out of place . As we left the theatre he turned to me and said " Didn't you think the end was like Butch Cassidy ! "  
  Part Two picks up .. not where the last film left off . As part of the quasi-conventionality of Steven Soderbergh 's epic 4 + hour event , Che 's two stories are told as classic " Rise " and " Fall " scenarios . In Part Two , Che Guevara , leaving his post as a bureaucrat in Cuba and after a failed attempt in the Congo ( only in passing mentioned in the film ) , goes down to Bolivia to try and start up another through-the-jungle style revolution . Things don't go quite as well planned , at all , probably because of Che 's then notorious stature as a Communist and revolutionary , and in part because of America 's involvement on the side of the Bolivian Government , and , of course , that Castro wasn't really around as a back-up for Che . As it goes , the second part of Che is sadder , but in some ways wiser than the first part . Which makes sense , as Guevara has to endure low morale from his men , betrayals from those around him , constant mistakes by grunts and nearby peasants , and by ultimately the enclosing , larger military force . But what 's sadder still is that Guevara , no matter what , won't give in . One may see this as an incredible strength or a fatal flaw - maybe both - but it 's also clear how one starts to see Che , if not totally more fully rounded , then as something of a more sympathetic character . True , he did kill , and executed , and felt justified all the way . And yet it starts to work on the viewer in the sense of a primal level of pity ; the sequence where Guevara 's health worsens without medicine , leading up to the shocking stabbing of a horse , marks as one of the most memorable and satisfying of any film this year . Again , Soderbergh 's command of narrative is strong , if , on occasion , slightly sluggish ( understandable due to the big running time ) , and one or two scenes just feel totally odd ( Matt Damon ? ) , but these are minor liabilities . Going this time for the straight color camera approach , this is almost like a pure militia-style war picture , told with a great deal of care for the men in the group , as well as Guevara as the Lord-over this group , and how things dwindle down the final scene . And as always , Del-Toro is at the top of his game , in every scene , every beat knowing this guy so well - for better and for worse - that he comes about as close to embodiment as possible . Overall , the two parts of Che make up an impressive package : history as drama in compelling style , good for an audience even if they don't know Che or , better , if they don't think highly of him . It 's that special . 8.5/10  
  From the filmmakers who brought us The March of the Penguins , I guess that came with plenty of expectations for The Fox and the Child . From the harsh winters of the South Pole to the lush wilderness in France , the narrative now becomes part documentary and part fairy tale , which tells of the friendship between the two titular characters , Renard the fox and its friendship with the child who christened it , played by Bertille Noel-Beuneau . The story 's frankly quite simple , and at times this movie would have looked like the many Japanese movies which children-miscellaneous animals striking a friendship after the development of trust , and how they go about hanging around each other , dealing with respective adversaries and the likes . Here , the child meets the elegant fox near her home up in the mountains , which provide for plenty of beautiful picture-postcard perfect shots that a cinematographer will have to go into overdrive to capture . But while we indulge in wistful scenery , the characters don't get to establish that level of trust from the onset , and we have to wait a few seasons to past , and 45 minutes into the film , before they find a leveler in food . The child persistently attempts at striking a bond with the objective of taming the creature for her own amusement , but the fox , well , as other notions of course . While I thought the narrative was pretty weak , unlike March of the Penguins which has that human narrative interpretation of what 's happening on screen , what excelled here were the documentary elements of the movie , tracing the life and times of the fox as both a predator , and a prey . Between the two , more tension and drama was given to the latter , especially when dealing with traditional foes like wolves , and granted , those sequences were fairly intense especially when the child got embroiled in it . Otherwise , it was plain sailing and quite a bore as the two of them go about their playing with each other , in shots that you know have undergone some movie magic editing . There were surprisingly dark moments in the movie that weren't really quite suitable for children , as those in the same hall attested to it by bawling their eyes out suddenly , so parents , you might want to take note and not let your toddler disturb the rest of the movie goers . As a film , I would 've preferred this to be a complete documentary ala The March of the Penguins , but I guess the way it was resented , probably had the objective of warning us not to meddle with nature , and that some things are just not meant to be , and should stay as such . Decent movie that leaned on the strength of the chemistry between Bertille Noel - Bruneau , and the multiple foxes that played Renard .  
  At first , this movie seems so bad that i almost fell in a trance the first time i saw it . It was like a bad dream . A cosmic bore . But i gave it a second chance , then another and another , etc .. I finally got addicted to this film , due to it 's dreamlike slow pace , wonderful natural sets , bathed in a mellow autumn light and especially the musical score , which is made of some 70 's progressive rock and absolute exquisite folk songs by actor / singer / songwriter Derek Lamb ( the Troubadour ) . You should notice the song about hazel wood , silver trout and lady vanishing in the air .. , heard in the middle and near the end of the film . There are some carnal scenes in the beginning , wich allow us to appreciate the natural charms of Elizabeth Suzuki . If that movie had been made by some " repertoire " directors like Bergman , Lars Von Triers or Jean-Luc Goddard , critics would have rolled on the floor , raving about that movie as if it were a cosmic masterpiece . I personally think this film is one million times superior to any of Fellini 's cinematic sh # ¤ @ t ! Definitely not for the pretentious .  
  ( contains slight spoilers ) It 's interesting how Anthony Mann uses James Stewart here . Stewart is , of course , remembered by many as George Bailey from Frank Capra 's " It 's a Wonderful Life " , so it 's easy to find parallels between the two films . In " It 's a Wonderful Life " , Bailey gets to see the world as it would have been if he had never been born . In " The Far Country " , Stewart 's Jeff Webster , by not getting involved to help anyone else ( except himself ) , gets to see essentially the same thing : A world in which he ( for all practical matters ) doesn't exist . By not getting involved ( and by attempting not to care about anyone ) , Webster is forced to see those for whom he can't help but care get hurt , pushed around , and even killed while he stands by and does nothing . This reminds the viewer of George Bailey watching a world that has turned upside-down because he has also decided not to get involved by not ever having been born . Both movies end with the same image - a close-up of a ringing bell . Stewart , by turning around his philosophy of non-involvement , has , it would seem , earned his " wings " .  
  This story is a familiar one in the long-running Tom and Jerry cartoons , especially in the 1940s , the only difference being that two cats instead of one are threatened to be evicted if they don't catch the mouse ( Jerry ) . Tom has an unnamed buddy ( " Butch ? " ) living in the house with him , so this really upsets " Mammy Two Shoes " who can't believe that they have a mouse despite TWO cats in the house . Anyway , the one who catches Jerry can stay while the other gets the boot , so the competition is on ! Even though it 's familiar territory I still enjoyed this because the cartoon had enough original sight gags to make entertaining . You not only had the cats competing against each but Jerry in the equation as well , so there were enough good gags to definitely recommend if you are a Tom & Jerry fan .  
  A typical romp through Cheech and Chong 's reality which includes drugs , singing , more drugs , cars and driving , even more drugs , Pee Wee , aliens , gasoline , laundry , stand up comedy , surprisingly more drugs and SPACE COKE ! . It is not as coherent or plausible as Up in Smoke but it still is incredibly funny , without becoming as strange as Nice Dreams . There are some classic scenes , which include the opening scene where they get some gas for their car and the drive to work . Also funny is Cheech 's song ( Mexican-Americans ) and Chong 's follow up song . Another notable scene is the welfare office scene with Jones ( human noise machine ) , from the Police Academy series , and the old laughing man . All in all , this is a great follow up to Up in Smoke and is quite watchable when sober or not . - Celluloid Rehab  
  In 1930 , Europe received quite a shock when Luis Bunuel 's ' L'Age Dor ' was released , causing a riot in Paris when screened there , resulting in it being banned for something like over forty years . Three years later , in 1933 , when Europe had gotten over the shock , it was once again turned on it 's ear with ' Ekstase ' , a symphony ( of sorts ) to love . The film starred a young , unknown German actress named Hedwig Kiesler , who would later change her name to Hedy Lamarr , when she moved to America to escape the madness of Adolf Hitler , as Eva , a young bride who has just married a cold , distant loveless husband ( played by Emil Jerman ) , only to discover that she has made a major mistake . One divorce later , Eva is footloose & fancy free & is out one day , skinny dipping in a lake , when she discovers Adam , a handsome , young engineer ( played by Aribert Mog ) who takes a real fancy to her ( and she , him ) . After a wild night of passion , Eva 's ex-husband turns up once again , hoping to win Eva back , only to find he now has a rival . I won't spoil what transpires . Czech director , Gustav Machaty ( who directed the original screen version of ' Madam X ' , another parable in romantic obsession ) directs from a screenplay by Jacques Koerpel , Frantisek Horky & Machaty , from the novel by Robert Horky . The film 's velvety cinematography ( which reminded me of Avant Garde photographer , Man Ray 's photos of the era , which goes for some impressionistic use of light & shadow , a lot ) is by Hans Androschin & Jan Stallich ) . The film 's brisk editing is by Antonin Zelenka & the films art direction , which goes for a lush , nearly Art Deco look , is by Bohumil Hes ) . If I have any quirk about this film , it is the music score , by Giuseppe Becce , which goes for an over the top , melodramatic feel to it that gets old fast ( certain themes are repeated over & over again , wearing out it 's welcome , fast-kind of like some of David Lean 's over use of certain musical themes , especially in ' Lawrence Of Arabia ' , and ' Dr . Zhivago ' ) . Some years back , a brand new restored print was made up of the best source material , cobbled together from various European existing prints available , restoring it to what is quite possibly the closest version of what it originally looked like before the Vatican condemned it as " decadent " ( yeah , right .. like the Church never did anything wrong ) , and the Hayes office cut it to ribbons , when it was finally released in the U.S.A. in 1936 , in a " Hayes Office " approved cut ( likewise ) . Minimal dialog in German with English subtitles ( it was meant to be a mainly visual experience ) . Not rated , but contains that infamous nude skinny dipping scene by Hedy Lamarr ( done tastefully , mind you ) & some suggestions of sexual content ( likewise ) that would scarcely earn it a PG-13 rating , nowadays . Worth a look if you have any interest in early European cinema , or Avant Garde / Experimental cinema  
  I saw " The Grudge " yesterday , and wow .. I was really scared , a good thing . I love horror-movies , and I really liked this one . There were so many ' surprise'-scenes ( what 's the English word ? ) that made you jump in your seat . Though , too much screaming from the audience made it difficult not to laugh . I think the most scary scene was .. on the bus , when the face flashes by on the window , or when Yoko 's walking without her chin . The make-up is also VERY good . Sometimes you could really see it was there , but it was still adding a freaky look to the scene . The boy was very good indeed , so cute without make-up and so terribly scary with it on . The next time I hear a cracking noise I will probably feel pretty scared ..  
  It is said that David Lynch 's films and shorts won't appeal to everyone . Neither will Dumbland , maybe more than ever . I have a feeling that Dumbland , as people come across it , will be a true mark of ' I get it ' or ' what the hell ' . It 's not surrealism exactly , but absurd to the point of no return . It 's also very , very , very stupid . But in this stupidity can be a sort of ironic intelligence to it , that the maker knows so well how childish and repugnant this is , and this self-consciousness is a plus , not a detraction . It 's just a bunch of crudely drawn shorts - the kind that might not even make it on Hertzfeldt and Judge 's Animation show ( which , I might add , Lynch here has a lot in common with both directors in their work - centered on a lummox with an IQ of 20 who has a constantly quivering-with-fear wife , and a child who looks like a cross between the gingerbread man and / or an alien . The episodes include little situations like a faulty treadmill , a salesman who can recite the Gettysburg address , watching over a sick brother in law , ant hallucinations , and just wallowing on the couch with noise all around . All the while , Lynch is still experimenting , as he was constantly for better or worse during the period of five years he made on and off Inland Empire . For one thing , he 's going back to the roots of his very first short , Six Figures Getting Sick Six Times , in the usage of repetition as a means to an end . This sometimes works excruciatingly well , and sometimes not . Sometimes , like with the episode with the sitting around the house doing nothing as teeth are bleeding and a fly buzzes around , the absurdism sort of waxes and wanes without much of a good effect . And even an episode like with the guy 's friend coming over is funny more-so for the Beavis & Butt-head comparison ( both laugh like idiots , and are equally engrossed by killing things like fish and sheep ) . What ends up working is how Lynch shows up front delirious abstractions , in the crudest ways imaginable , and excessive violence . In what comes closest to surrealism in " ants " , the guy mistakenly sprays bug-spray ( just called " Kill " , one of Lynch 's very cheap but fun pokes at societal conventions ) on himself , and envisions ants in a musical chorus line , solos included . And one of the most harrowingly funny things I 've ever seen from the filmmaker is " get the stick " , where we just see the guy , cheered on by his son , getting a stick lodged in his mouth . Soon the neck breaks , eyes pop out , and once said stick is removed he doesn't watch out for traffic waddling like a manhole cover . Other moments pop up like this in unexpected crevices , and it 's drawn as if on cheap paper with an impetus to shock with foul-mouthed language ( mostly from the man , as well as from the ' grandmother ' , who in one of Lynch 's voices for the characters is the deepest of all ) , and a shaky quality that 's reminiscent of the cream of the crop from ( early ) Hertzfeldt . All the same I 'm still not sure if Dumbland is something I would put into someone 's hands if they haven't seen much of Lynch yet let alone anything by him . There are some little points on society made via complete exaggerations that may or may not be in Lynch 's mind closer than we usually think to those in real life . However in general there 's not a whole lot that should be read into it , which is why I 'd say more than half who see it will hate it with a passion . Those who dig the bottom-less pits of animated comedy , be prepared have a blast .  
  If you have any kind of heart and compassion for people , this is a tough movie to watch , at least in the second half of it . It 's in that segment where we see nice little kid get beaten up and then a retarded ( mentally - challenged ) man go off the deep end after he witnesses this brutal act against the child . It 's not pleasant material . However , it 's a good movie and the acting is good , too . The story will sit with you awhile . " Dominick " is the mentally-disabled guy and is played by Tom Hulce . I think this might be Hulce 's best role ever . He 's looked after by a med student , " Eugene , " played by Ray Liotta , who became a star the following year with Kevin Costner 's " Field Of Dreams . " Dominick is a goodhearted garbage man who reads " Hulk " comic books and loves wrestling . He 's the type of " slow " guy that you can't help but love and root for to live a happy life . When he freaks out , it 's for several good reasons and .. well , see the film for the whole story . It 's worth your time but be prepared to go on real emotional roller coaster and possibly be very upset at some things you see .  
  I collect Horror films from all over and I have seen the good and the very bad - Zombie Bloodbath is a low budget video . Sure , the acting is bad , the storyline is basically a mix of all zombie movies thrown together and the quality is low in some spots . The thing you seem to be missing is that it 's still entertaining and really very fun . The effects range from , like someone on here has said , pasty-faced zombies that look like KISS rejects to really good ones with some amazing latex work . But the reason you buy a movie with a title like this is for the gore and this film is amazing in that area . The effects are very good for such a small film . Someone called it a Party movie and it is . 100 % fun party movie . I have heard from various websites that this is actually a " rough cut " of the film that got general release but the actual " director 's cut " is coming on DVD and it is very nice quality . I will buy it and judge for myself . Story is basically a Nuclear power plant goes bad and makes zombies . The gov't closes it down , hides the story and sanctions houses to be built over it . Some of the plant is still underground and these undead come up and attack the area . A few actors do a great job , there 's some pretty straight social commentary that is insightful and true , good music , great lighting , some effective suspense and tons of blood and sick gore . One guy gets attacked and ripped from the lower area all the way up , if you know what I mean . Then his guts are shoved out of his mouth . Another is torn in half like in Day Of The Dead and they did a great job of that effect . There are a million gore gags and it 's almost ALL action . I say stop being a prude , enjoy life and get more movies like Zombie Bloodbath and Meat market . Two great undead epics . OK - UPDATE ! I just got the DVD set and here is what I thought : MUCH better picture quality and for once I was able to see the actual DIRECTOR 'S CUT of the film and it is a much better movie . I liked it before , but now I can see what Todd Sheets was actually trying to do with this one . And the commentary helps too , hearing Sheets talk about the film in detail , He knows it 's a trashy zombie movie , but he does show respect to all people involved . Also , Sheets has a great sense of humor and some humble integrity that others could learn from in the movie field . The behind the scenes of Zombie Bloodbath is pretty fun as well . I felt it was almost as entertaining as the film it was made for . There are some great interviews and behind the scenes footage , mixed with news stories about the film from some major places like CNN , FOX and MTV . Over all , a fun little film that is VERY rough around the edges , but still had me laughing and enjoying the ride ! I have seen many DV films , and some shot of video films , and many are quite dull , but this one really wasn't . While newer DV films are technically superior , they just aren't this much fun ! PS - I heard they are now remaking this on a big budget ?  
  Zombie Bloodbath is a movie made by zombie fans for zombie fans with a true love of the Horror genre . As I understand it from the commentary and things I have read , it was made during the huge Midwest flood of 1993 when half of Missouri was underwater . Buildings were under water . cars and houses were underwater . One article said that zombies and the crew from this movie would help sandbag the river after shooting each day . The fact this movie got made at all is a miracle . It is like a huge mashing of every zombie movie ever made put through a Troma filter . It is a party movie to enjoy with friends who like loads of splatter and goofy characters . And it is fast paced and energetic and really funny . A toxic spill accident in a nuclear power facility causes people to melt down or turn into zombies . The local Government covers it up , tears down the factory and builds houses over it . Some ground shifting ( ? ) causes a cave opening to develop and some new residents find the cave and unleash the undead on the newly built community . From there it just gets crazy and gory and fun . I have read these reviews on here a few times . And it seems obvious to me that the same person attacked this fun little movie three times as a different reviewer , using fake names . They use the same words and sentences . Zombie Bloodbath is cheap . It is raw . It has some bad acting . So does half the movies made . There is much much WORSE out there than this fun movie . If you hate this film so much , don't buy it . There is no need for personal attacks and to call the crew or cast " Trailer Trash . " And it is obvious you are not from Australia or England . It is just upsetting that this great service , the IMDb does not catch people using it just to trash others . There are bad reviews and good reviews , and I don't mind those . I give both bad and good reviews myself . But it is painfully obvious that some fool just wants to use this forum to personally attack the director of this movie . Sad . Some of these so called " Reviewers " even basically sue their " review " just to promote their own movies . One called this film Boring - well , love it or hate it , one thing you can NEVER say about this film is that it is boring . It moves fast and never has a dull spot . Oh and this reviewer from The Netherlands ? Um - LIAR . You tried to post this same review at Amazon and it got yanked there . The SAME review only it said it was from Missouri . This nonsense HAS to stop . Love it or Hate it - give it a real review or type nothing . It is obvious you have not seen the films . But for the record , I have and though this one is not nearly the best that I have seen , it is far from the worst . And even the worst I would give an actual REVOEW and would not attack the director personally . Hope this review helps some people see through the stupidity going on here .  
  Despite its budget limitations , this is a great film , proof that effort and imagination can overcome lack of cash . The opening , in which cave-paintings seem to show how some dinosaurs at least survived into the age of human beings , is a nice red herring . After that , a meteor comes down into a lake and causes heat which , in turn , causes the hatching of a frozen dinosaur egg ( maybe the cave-paintings suggest instead that this isn't the first time such a thing has happened ) . When the prehistoric beast appears , it 's a well-animated Plesiosaur which is soon causing disappearances in the local area . Alright , so it 's not Jurassic Park , but it 's still genuine entertainment for fans of monster movies .  
  Mr Michael Jackson is an artistic phenomenon . His short movies , i . e . music videos , are simply the best . I do not care if I get a sane sci-fi feature from this man , but I do care to get a medley of his crazy dancing , shriek yells , cool crowd choreography , and some bits of CGI and animation . There also should be a few uninterrupted videos . Everything I 've mentioned is here . Stupid plot and over-the-top " vanity fair " are not a problem when I witness Mr Michael Jackson in action . To me he will always be the ultimate king of music videos ( not " king of pop " which sounds moronic , especially for us , Russians , because " pop " sounds like the Russian word for " arses " and MJ is definitely not " king of arses " ) . I can re-watch his best music videos ( which are artistically beautiful ) and I never get tired of them . My first impression of this film was " What is this .. ? " ( bits of different videos , some drawn images , unsettling jumps from one theme to another , absence of any cohesive plot line , some kids fooling around , etc . ) but as I watched it till the end , I could tell that it was great and really nothing like anything else shown on TV nowadays . What I like here too is that it never shows any shameful material and can be watched by kids easily . Without Mr Michael Jackson the universe of music videos would be rather poor . Even the best classic videos of other artists cannot come very close to the energetic hyperbole of MJ musical insanity and artistic quality . He knew how to get the audience of different ages and he knew how to remain a man with moral principles . When I see a proper DVD release with Mr Michael Jackson videos I know that it deserves to be purchased even if some clips have already appeared in some other previous release . " HIStory I " , " HIStory II " , and " Moonwalker " are all great , though only " Moonwalker " is more like one movie ( with a solid " Smooth Criminal " theme , " paparazzi " topic , and a few weird spoofs and twists ) . Being no fan of MJ I can still give this " film .. like no other " a solid 9 out of 10 ( I 've been hit by " Smooth Criminal " for sure and my major complains are the following : initial segments of the movie could have been dropped while the main " MJ anti-drug campaign " should have been given more " sky-rocketing insanity and stress " and there should have been more " moonwalking " itself of course ) . Thanks for attention .  
  With all this stuff going down at the moment with MJ i 've started listening to his music , watching the odd documentary here and there , watched The Wiz and watched Moonwalker again . Maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really cool in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent . Moonwalker is part biography , part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released . Some of it has subtle messages about MJ 's feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad m'kay . Visually impressive but of course this is all about Michael Jackson so unless you remotely like MJ in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring . Some may call MJ an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie BUT MJ and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of him . The actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for 20 minutes or so excluding the Smooth Criminal sequence and Joe Pesci is convincing as a psychopathic all powerful drug lord . Why he wants MJ dead so bad is beyond me . Because MJ overheard his plans ? Nah , Joe Pesci 's character ranted that he wanted people to know it is he who is supplying drugs etc so i dunno , maybe he just hates MJ 's music . Lots of cool things in this like MJ turning into a car and a robot and the whole Speed Demon sequence . Also , the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy Bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scene . Bottom line , this movie is for people who like MJ on one level or another ( which i think is most people ) . If not , then stay away . It does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically MJ 's bestest buddy in this movie is a girl ! Michael Jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty ? Well , with all the attention i 've gave this subject .. hmm well i don't know because people can be different behind closed doors , i know this for a fact . He is either an extremely nice but stupid guy or one of the most sickest liars . I hope he is not the latter .  
  The story of peace-loving farmers and townspeople fighting for land , water , law and order , and the respect and ultimate subjugation of the long entrenched cattle interests and their hired guns had been worked over better in earlier ( Shane ) and probably later films as well . There 's some good action scenes and the general layout of the story , excluding a disappointing ending , is well executed . Law and order and religion have established roots in the town , but the old order of cattle drives , cowboys , and gunslingers is still around as well . The clash of the two occurs in a nicely staged ambush scene where the townsmen ride right into a trap . Granger , an ex-gunfighter , plays the guy who is shunned by the very townspeople who need his expertise with a gun .  
  Can I be as simple and primitive in my evaluations as to simply say " I liked it " ? It 's reasonably funny by bits , it got great stars and it 's gorgeous to look at . The songs ( there are about two which are then repeated ) are forgettable , but they get a healthy ironic treatment ( such as the terribly handsome Mr Fairbanks exploding into frenzied Wagnerian version of the tender ballad Miss Grable has just rendered ) ; there isn't much dancing with all the 1861 crinolines draped around Miss Grable , and the comedy might be a bit heavy handed , but the result still is very uplifting . The photography ( including real outdoor shots which are a thrill ) is amazing , playing around with different shades of lush heavy gold . Miss Grable is a bit past her prime and on the plumpish side , but still fresh and comfortable in this continental " olde worlde " comedy . It 's pretty much along the line of " Down to Earth " with Rita Hayworth , and that one tends to be rather disliked by many . So I suppose several people would deem " That Lady in Ermine " to be outdated and stuffy . But it 's a fairy tale , and these tend to move along at a certain paste anyhow . My suggestion is - just enjoy the artwork , the costumes , the witty script and everything else this film has to offer , and stop complaining . The film has been released on DVD in Germany , with both German and English soundtrack .  
  There isn't a whole lot going on in this story - just two men employing very different ways of handling memories of Vietnam . But what it lacks in premise , it more than makes up for in acting and realism . It 's a quiet film about the bonds of friendship and shared experience . We even get romance ( not gratuitous - just another very real piece of this story ) . It 's well worth seeing .  
  I had read an article about Dan Jansen 's Olympic and personal journey before seeing this movie . I 'm always intrigued by a story of hope and overcoming life altering events , and this was no exception . The background of the characters that is provided gives you a sense of the family 's closeness and how they positively affected each others ' lives . I can't speak to the accuracy of specific details in this movie , it is customary to take some creative license when organizing a script . However , the spirit of Dan and his family is what matters here . Its a worthwhile movie of a story that should be told . I felt empathy for the characters and cheered at the end .  
  Cute idea .. salesgirl Linda Smith ( Yolande Donlan ) inherits a teeny tiny little county of Lampidorra . That country , which wasn't even in North America , was made the 49th state .. ( of course , there were only 48 states at the time , since this was made in 1952 .. ) Linda travels to the country she has inherited , and we follow her along as she tries to figure out what to do with this strange country and its even quirkier people . At one point , she sings a song that she claims is from her people the Navajo , and it gets ever-more sillier from there .. although Yolande Donlan 's heavy lipstick and omni-present smile never get ruffled or shmeared . There are other songs scattered through-out as the citizens sing to welcome their new princess . Filmed in a glorious British version of technicolor , or some such equivalent , about the only big name here is Dirk Bogarde as British subject Tony Craig , cheese vendor . Bogarde made a big splash in the UK film industry after serving in the war , and was even knighted by QE II . Craig and " the new princess " keep bumping into each other , and their adventures become more intertwined as Lampidorra 's financial problems worsen .. Fun little farce .. along the lines of Marx Brothers film . Also note that Donlan later married Val Guest , the writer and director of our little project , and stayed married for 50 years ! Guest was better known for writing and directing his sci-fi flicks , in both the UK & the US .  
  13 days to Glory tells the traditional tale with sympathy toward the Mexican viewpoint . The major problem in this movie was that while cowboy actor James Arness played the part of Jim Bowie persuasively , the rest of the name actors in the cast Brian Keith ( Davy Crocket ) and Lorne Greene ( Sam Houston ) were too old . Raul Julia played General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna with grace and dignity owed to the professional soldier who after all won the battle . The scene where he upbraids his officers for failing to mount a guard and prevent a sortee is one the scriptwriters did not understand . Failing to keep watch is a major remiss in the military . Santa Anna was within his prerogatives to be angry . Raul Julia magnificently carried poor writing through the scene . Kathleen York was an impressive Susannah Dickinson , a woman who deserves to be remembered for her courage . However , Kathleen York might have been reminded that as Dickinsons hailed from Pennsylvania they probable dis not sound very Southron .  
  It 's great to see Jorja Fox in a role where she gets to smile a lot . Also loved hearing her sing . Nice change to see her out of her CSI / West Wing / ER roles . The movie itself was entertaining , but it seemed skip some explanation in a lot of parts . Several of the characters seemed to be miserable one minute and happy the next and it was left up to your imagination to figure out why . Each character was quirky though and in some cases , I couldn't wait to see what they would do next or hear what they would say next . This movie wasn't full of squeaky clean people , but rather complicated realistic people who could make mistakes , feel bad about them and then find a way to fix them .  
  I came in in the middle of this film so I had no idea about any credits or even its title till I looked it up here , where I see that it has received a mixed reception by your commentators . I 'm on the positive side regarding this film but one thing really caught my attention as I watched : the beautiful and sensitive score written in a Coplandesque Americana style . My surprise was great when I discovered the score to have been written by none other than John Williams himself . True he has written sensitive and poignant scores such as Schindler 's List but one usually associates his name with such bombasticities as Star Wars . But in my opinion what Williams has written for this movie surpasses anything I 've ever heard of his for tenderness , sensitivity and beauty , fully in keeping with the tender and lovely plot of the movie . And another recent score of his , for Catch Me if You Can , shows still more wit and sophistication . As to Stanley and Iris , I like education movies like How Green was my Valley and Konrack , that one with John Voigt and his young African American charges in South Carolina , and Danny deVito 's Renaissance Man , etc . They tell a necessary story of intellectual and spiritual awakening , a story which can't be told often enough . This one is an excellent addition to that genre .  
  Heart pounding erotic drama are the words that come to mind when I think of " Secret Games " . It becomes more erotic as the film goes along and at one point blew me away ! I didn't expect the delightful scene I was about to encounter . The " call girl " has her first customer and what a customer ! One of the most erotic lesbian scenes I have ever seen . The husband should have listened to his wife and perhaps she wouldn't have gone on this erotic journey . It turned out to cost them in the end but , it was one exciting ride ! GO SEE THIS MOVIE !  
  I was pleasantly surprised by the film . Let 's face it ; the premise doesn't sound particularly appealing when having to hand over money for a the night 's flick , but it had an easygoing nature that wins one over . There were no moments that I found uproarious , and I doubt any that I 'll remember the next day , but this doesn't fail as a nice diversion . What I found funny was watching it here in Peking with my Chinese girlfriend who never understands anything I like . I told her there was a plot - three guys have to bring back some weed to London . Hardly satisfying for her . There is no mugging going on here for the camera which I 'd been expecting after reading a number of the comments . I do take exception however to comparisons with Withnail and I ; not in the same league , and I doubt was it intended to . ww . imperialflags . blogspot . com  
  Freebird is the perfect marriage of road trip comedy , gang caper , " stoner " film and feel-good British movie . It is the brilliant lead characters that set this movie apart from other films in this genre . Stars Phil Daniels , Gary Stretch and Geoff Bell have a great chemistry and make their characters hugely likable and realistic . The main story centres around their road trip from London to Wales , and the adventures and mishaps that occur along the way . This small film also has a great heart - it is not just for bike fans , as it bases around the character 's relationships with each other including dreams and regrets , such as Gary Stretch 's Fred longing for the family he left behind . The cinematography is also great - a love letter to the Welsh countryside as well as capturing the grittiness of London streets and typical pub life in the Welsh country towns . Stylish , slick , fantastic soundtrack , likable characters and funny storyline - I would recommend Freebird in a heartbeat !  
  Branagh and Fishburne deliver excellent performances in this version of the Shakespeare classic . Branagh plays Iago better than I 've seen the character played in film or on stage . Some might say this film is overly Iago-centric , but I disagree . Fishburne , the first black Othello in film history ironically , delivers a powerful performance . Fishburne has always been a good actor , but this performance as the Moor of Venice may be one of his best . The one problem I have with this film , is the simple subtraction of a number of important scenes . Desdemona 's character is given far less depth than she has in the play . In this film , she might as well not be added at all . One of the worst cuts made by Branagh in this film , was the subtraction of a conversation between Iago and Desdemona at the beginning of the second act . This part of the play shows that Desdemona may not be the innocent child she is portrayed as in this film . There were a number of subtractions that hurt the integrity of this film . However , if you have not read the play , or seen a film version of Othello before , I recommend this movie . The story , cut or not , is still incredibly enthralling . The acting , as stated previously , is very good . If some important scenes had been added , and Desdemona 's character been prioritized a bit further , this would be a great movie . As it stands , it 's still an admirable version of the original . I give it a marginal recommendation .  
  envy is not as funny as i thought it would initially be , but after some of the reviews i read i found it to be much funnier than people was giving it props for , now true its not a gag a minute movie like zoolander or dodgeball , but ben stiller and jack black work well with each other and christopher walken is as great as ever , so the story is about jack black 's character inventing a spray that makes dog pooh disappear , obviosly ben wants no part of it , but when the product makes jack black rich ben stiller starts to see the envy , its not great by all means and both ben stiller and jack black have funnier and better movies under their belt , but if your a fan of either i recommend this as its still a funny flick and i laughed my ass off quite a few times , as a big fan of ben stiller id have to say this is a lesser stiller but still great fun , give it a watch  
  I saw the movie recently during the Boston Film festival . The movie was very entertaining and is something that I believe the world , and black America is ready to see . It has comedy , drama , the soundtrack is great . It is an all around good film . The characters were well developed , and the movie had a wide variety of prominent actors , such as Wood Harris ( Remember the Titains , Paid in Full ) , Brian J . White ( Trois 3 , Mr 3000 ) , and the wonderful Zoe Saldana ( Drumline , Pirates of the Caribbean ) . The movie tackles many relevant topics in todays society in a short period of time , and does so with class and grace . This is not only a story about life in the hospital , however it is a story about people and their personal journey to discovering who they are , or who they are going to be .  
  This movie is goofy as hell ! I think it was written as a serious film , but then when it came time to film , Michael Cooney said " Hey , let 's throw in some humor and spice it up ! " The characters are actually slightly developed , too . Oh , and the death sequences are the best . One thing I hate , though , was the hairdryer-weapons . What was that all about ?  
  Surprisingly good . The acting was fun , the screenplay was fun , the music was cheesie fun , the plot was stupendously fun . This was a fun movie to watch and to give your brain some rest . Parts of the plot and quotes I found to be very creative . 7 out of 10 . Actually for what it was , it would deserve a 10 out of 10 . You are not supposed to compare this to an arthouse film or to a bloody slasher film .  
  This is an old fashioned , wonderfully fun children 's movie with surely the most appealing novice witch ever . Unlike many modern stories which seem to revel in dark witchcraft , this is simply a magical tale of hocus pocus that is cute , light hearted , and charming . The tale is set back in 1940 in the English village of Peppering Eye , where three Cockney children , Charlie , Carrie , & Paul Rollins , are being evacuated out of danger from World War II city air raids . They are mistakingly sent to live with Eglantine Price , who is studying by correspondence course to become an apprentice witch . Eglantine and the trio of children use a magic bed knob in order to travel to London on their flying bed . Here they encounter Emilius Browne , the fraudulent headmaster of Miss Price 's witchcraft training correspondence school . Miss Price sets about working on spells designed to bring inanimate objects to life . Meanwhile , they must also deal with a shady character called the Bookman and his associate , Swinburne . Angela Lansbury is of course marvelously endearing as the eccentric witch in training , Miss Price . David Tomlinson plays Mr . Browne , headmaster of the defunct witchcraft school , who has now turned street magician . This actor was previously cast as the children 's father in the movie Mary Poppins . In fact , this film is a tale quite reminiscent of the earlier Mary Poppins , both wonderful fantasy stories for children . Perhaps this movie doesn't have quite such memorable music as Chim-Chim-Cheree , but it does boast some appealing little tunes . Some have been critical , but the movie features excellent special effects . All in all , the story is enchanting family entertainment . It 's a pity if modern children are too sophisticated for this lovely & bewitching tale , which should appeal to the child in all of us .  
  Okay , this film is about Bedknobs and Broomsticks , it 's one of the most charming , delightful movies you 'll ever see as a kid . It 's the unforgettable movie about two adults and two spunky kids on an adventure for fun . It may be a little deniable to watch , but try it , I neither my mother didn't think it was bad , I was very enthused with the movie and the animation , they were all quite good . It is a delightfully wondrous comedy for the whole family to enjoy ; even the kids . Ages 7 years and up will enjoy this wonderful , musical comedy with you and your family especially the animation . The animation movements and layouts are really nice and deserve a thumbs up . It 's a terrifically good musical for the whole family so what are you waiting for ? Go to the video store and rent Bedknobs and Broomsticks NOW .  
  IN LOVING MEMORY OF DAVID TOMLINSON ( 1917-2000 ) When I watched this movie for the first time I was 4 years old and I got fascinated by this story of witches in the 2nd World War . The scene , which impressed me the most , was the fight between the Nazi soldiers and the medieval army . It was exceptional to see this army without a body walk to fight the astonished singing their march . This movie is fantastic , from the trip to Portobello Road ( which became to me the most fantastic place of London ) to the journey to Naboomboo . Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson are really a fantastic couple . She is always great , it seems the good aunt of a family and David with his always astonished face is her great co-protagonist . we 'll miss him a lot .  
  What a wonderful , fanciful movie " Stardust " is . I could easily end it with that one statement and suffice to say , one could take it as a very strong recommendation to go see it . At a time when Hollywood seems bent on forcing remakes and sequels down our throats , " Stardust " makes us remember why we go to the movies in the first place - to escape reality for a couple of hours and explore other lives , other times , or other planets . Ironically , " Stardust " takes us to all three places effortlessly and with a childlike glee we all long for . " Stardust " is full of all the characters we remember as children : princes , witches , pirates , ghosts and scoundrels . It has the damsel in distress , the hero , the rogues , the obstacles , spells , antidotes , charms , and even a touch of light-speed to make it quasi modern . " Stardust " is about a man from the town of Wall , which is conveniently situated next to a wall that separates their town from a magical kingdom . The only way past the wall is through a breech that is diligently guarded by a scruffy old codger ( played wonderfully by David Kelly ) . One day a young man from Wall named Ben Barnes out maneuvers the old guard and escapes through the breech . He happens upon an enchanted kingdom called Stormhold where he meets a chained ( and very sexy ) young lady named Una . She is held captive by a witch and leashed by an unbreakable chain . While the witch is away , Una seduces Ben and sends him on his way . Ben returns to Wall without incident and continues his life . But nine months later he is summoned to the wall breech where the old guard hands him what you might expect - a baby boy . The boy , named Tristan grows up to be a rather hapless young man ( Charlie Cox ) who is smitten with a girl way out of his league and also betrothed to another . Nevertheless , the young lady ( named Victoria and played Sienna Miller ) goes out once with Tristain and he confesses his love to her . After they espy a falling star , she tells him he can have her if he retrieves the star and brings it back to her . He agrees and sets out on his quest , which will take him to the other side of the wall . Meanwhile in the kingdom of Stormhold , the old king ( perfectly played by Peter O'Toole ) is dying . He calls his remaining living sons to tell them who shall succeed him to the throne . His sons ' names are Primus , Secondus , Sextmus , and Septimus . The other sons where killed by the other brothers in a humorous competition to see who lives to get the throne . Anyway , he tosses his ruby charm to the sky and Voila , that what brings the star to earth . The star crashes in the form of a beautiful woman named Yvaine ( Clare Danes ) and she , of course , is wearing the charm . But little does she know she is now being persuaded by Tristain , the Princes , and also an aging witch named Lamia ( Michelle Pfeiffer ) who wants to cut out the stars heart to regain her own youth . Complicated ? Yes . But it all comes together as the adventure unfolds . Tristain is the first to find Yvaine but is so blinded by his devotion to Victoria he doesn't recognize the growing bond between he and Yvaine . His initial interest lie only in returning Yvaine to Victoria as proof of his love . But he must get past the princes and Lamia first . The princes aren't that big an issue as they are constantly trying to kill each other - and just as in " Pirates of the Caribbean " - never has death been so funny . But Tristain also encounters the witch who enslaved his mother ( though he doesn't know it 's his mother ) and a band of flying pirates led by Robert DeNiro . His is the most important character in the movie and DeNiro plays it to a tee . He steals the movie with his toughness and soon we learn an undercover secret that will leave audiences on the floor with laughter . Though his role is small in length , DeNiro is extraordinary ! Michelle Pfeiffer is wonderful as Lamia - a sexy evil witch . Claire Danes is most appropriate as the confused and distressed Yvaine . She makes a perfect damsel . Jason Flemyng , Adam Buston , Rupert Everett , and Mark Strong add the perfect dose of levity as the fighting princes whom , as they die return as ghosts ala " Blithe Spirit " and " High Spirits " . Moreover director Matthew Vaughn , whose only other directing experience was " Layer Cake " , weaves an enchanting tale that everyone will enjoy . " Stardust " may be too complex for young children , but anyone over the age of 13 will want to see this movie multiple times . It 's that good . " Stardust " is what movies are supposed to be . Perfectly written , perfectly cast , perfectly directed , and perfectly acted . In other words .. perfect .  
  I was lucky enough to catch this film finally on Turner Classic films tonight , as it is one of the films that won an Oscar ( for special effects ) in their yearly month of Oscar winning films . BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS is easily a sequel film for the earlier success of MARY POPPINS . That film too was a big success , and an Oscar winner ( Best Actress for Julie Andrews ) . Like MARY POPPINS BEDKNOBS has David Tomlinson in it , in a role wherein he learns about parenting . It is a fine mixture of live action and animation . It is set in a past period of British history ( if not the Edwardian - Georgian world of 1912 London , it is England 's coastline during the " Dunkirk " Summer of 1940 ) . It even has old Reginald Owen in it , here as a General in the Home Guard , whereas formerly he was Admiral Boom in MARY POPPINS . Ironically it was Owen 's final role . The Home Guard sequences ( not too many in the film ) reminds one of the British series DAD 'S ARMY , dealing with the problems of the local home guard in the early years of the war . The period is also well suggested by the appearance of the three Rawlins children as war orphans from the bombings in the Blitz in London . And ( in typical Disney fashion ) in the musical number " Portobello Road " different members of the British Army ( including soldiers from India and the Caribbean ( complete with metal drums yet ! ) ) appear with Scottish and local female auxiliaries in costume . All of which , surprisingly , is a plus . But the biggest plus is that for Angela Lansbury , her performance as Eglantine Price is finally it : her sole real musical film lead . In a noteworthy acting career , Lansbury never got the real career musical role she deserved as Auntie Mame in the musical MAME that came out shortly after BEDKNOBS did . She had been in singing parts ( in GASLIGHT with her brief UP IN A BALLOON BOYS , and in THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY with LITTLE YELLOW BIRD , and - best of all - in support and in conclusion of THE HARVEY GIRLS with the final reprise of ON THE ATCHISON , TOPEKA , AND THE SANTA FE ) . But only here does she play the female lead . So when you hear her singing with David Tomlinson you may be able to understand what we lost when she did not play Mame Dennis Burnside . The rest of the cast is pretty good , Tomlinson here learning that he can rise to the occasion after a lifetime of relative failure . The three children ( Cindy O'Callaghan , Roy Snart , and Ian Weighill ) actually showing more interesting sides in their characters than their Edwardian predecessors in POPPINS ( Weighill in particular , as something of a budding opportunist thinking of blackmailing Lansbury after finding out she is a witch ) . The only surprising waste ( possibly due to cutting of scenes ) is Roddy McDowall as the local vicar who is only in two sequences of the film . With his possible role as a disapproving foe of witchcraft he should have had a bigger part . Also of note is John Ericson , as the German officer who leads a raid at the conclusion of the film , only to find that he is facing something more powerful than he ever imagined in the British countryside , and Sam Jaffe as a competitor for the magic formula that Lansbury and Tomlinson are seeking . As for the animation , the two sequences under the sea in a lagoon , and at the wildest soccer match ever drawn are well worth the view , with Tomlinson pulled into the latter as the referee , and getting pretty badly banged up in various charges and scrimmages . As I said it is a pretty fine sample of the Disney studio 's best work .  
  It is wonderful to watch Roshan Seth ( the strict father in 1992 " Mississippi Masala " ) , who once again takes on the role of a father and head of the family , and more , in SUCH A LONG JOURNEY , set in 1971 Bombay , India . Besides the closely knit family settings , subject matters include the lost and found of a friendship ; the unexpected death of a friend ( somehow the calm smiling face of a friend in death in the presence of prayers felt peaceful - so Gustad Noble , Roshan 's character , similarly noted ) ; a sidewalk artist 's chain of events - " the wall as a latrine turned into a shrineshrine into rumbles and ashes " was at once prophetic and philosophical . It 's packed full of life lessons in different aspects of varying relationships : between father and son ; mother and son ; father and little daughter ; little daughter and father and mother ; longtime colleagues ; long lost dear friends ; even that of a man to man , one whose an innocent slow-witted " fool " . In spite of the tone of the film 's era , it 's a colorful film rich in substance , and the strength of the story in textural layers with humor and suspense . For a director who is not Indian ( Sturla Gunnarsson being Icelandic ) , he 's made a political Indian / Pakistani film . He gets into the bone marrow of the life of this Parsi portrayed by Roshan Seth , whose performance has such nuances , subtlety , and joy . ( There is singing , too . ) The rest of the cast is equally strong : from Om Puri the mysterious friend of a friend ; Soni Razdan the enduring wife ; Vrajesh Hirjee the argumentative eldest son ; Sam Dastor the longtime office mate ; Ranjit Chowdhry the pavement artist ; to a superstitious " witch " woman of a neighbor ; an unbeguiling " fool " of a man ; and a long lost bosom friend - it 's a world of many faces and perspectives . Director Gunnarsson has demonstrated sensitivity in the treatment of that time period and subject was well researched with attention to details . He has the good fortune to have Sooni Taraporevala ( 1992 " Mississippi Masala " , 1988 " Salaam Bombay ! " ) wrote the script . This is truly a worthwhile journey of a film to partake . Along the lines of cultural exploration ( road movie style ) , Fridrik Thor Fridriksson 1994 " Cold Fever " is an Icelandic sojourn about a Japanese young man who went across the globe in search of the specific spot to pay his last respects to his parents , dutifully following memorial rituals for the dead . Such demonstrated reverence and cross-cultural attention to family ties are heart-warming in this day and cyber age .  
  Mitchell Leisen 's fifth feature as director , and he shows his versatility by directing a musical , after his previous movies were heavy dramas . He also plays a cameo as the conductor . You can tell it is a pre code movie , and nothing like it was made in the US for quite a while afterwards ( like 30 + years ) . Leisen shot the musical numbers so they were like what the audience would see - no widescreen shots or from above ala Busby Berkeley . What I do find funny or interesting is that you never actually see the audience . As others have mentioned the leads are fairly characterless , and Jack Oakie and Victor McLaghlan play their normal movie personas . Gertrude Michael however provides a bit of spark . The musical numbers are interesting and some good ( the Rape of the Rhapsody in particular is amusing ) but the drama unconvincing and faked - three murders is too many and have minimal emotional impact on the characters . This is where this movie could have been a lot better .  
  As someone who has seen and followed Hartley 's public work for several years I think much of what used to be fiction told through true stories has been elevated into obscure philosophical mind games . While entertaining , Fay Grim is another step in the Henry Fool line of thinking , where the movie reflects the quality of an object within the movie itself . In Henry Fool , the object is the memoirs .. In Fay Grim , the object is encrypted memoirs - which are themselves stolen , forged and trans-mutated into something so obscure it can't really make any sense - i . e . the process of script writing and film-making in the modern era - where most blockbuster films are little more than a mash-up of the past . That is , in a philosophical sense , what Fay Grim is all about . The object , perhaps , is the tragedy that shock is now cliché and dull ( as hinted in the opening scenes at the publishers office ) . That being said , many of the movie best points are lost if you do not understand Henry 's character and the significance of the memoirs being looked for . Henry is a thinly veiled devil , first visiting Simon as a modern Faust , etc . Without understanding how tragic Henry 's character is , much of the quality of Fay Grim 's plot and story is lost . And there is not enough ' detail ' expressed through verbal flashbacks - knowing the plot of Henry Fool cannot compare to ' feeling ' the quality of the characters as one did in Henry Fool , and so I think for someone who walks into this movie cold there is about 10 minutes of ' so what ' responses to highly constructed dialog and then that 's it . However , Henry Fool was also my least favorite Hartley film until I realized that it was bad - putrid and infested - precisely because Henry Fool 's confessions were bad .. not just raunchy or dirty , but inescapably broken . Henry can not even be a proper villain - and this is perhaps the tragic flaw that makes him most endearing .. like Gollum in Tolkien 's works , Henry is pitiable . That doesn't come across in Fay Grim , although Henry 's dialog is excellent . What does come across is that the entire movie is constructed as an encryption - a sort of molding of another plot around what ends up being yet another bad story to add to henry 's confessions . It is an interesting twist , but one that can't really be digested without viewing the first film . Perhaps showing more of Henry earlier on would have been better than having the publisher describe the basic storyline of the first movie - although this plot is also not really what the first movie was about - unless perhaps one is a casual observer . Part of the encryption ? Hard to say .. a little disappointed at the sex gimmicks though . Cheesy .  
  Perhaps I would have liked this film more if I wasn't so attached to the characters in Henry Fool . To those who 've never seen Henry Fool , I wouldn't worry . As Hartley jokingly said in his introduction to the film at TIFF , the film has lots of exposition and explanations . This film is very heavy in plot , which keeps the film moving . There are many humorous moments and the film certainly has Hartley 's trademark humour and rhythm of dialogue . Over all , a technically well made film and sure to satisfy new fans of Hartley who are just beginning explore his work . As for the older fans who loved his earlier works like Trust and Amateur , this film could go either way . I have mixed feelings about the film and Hartley 's later films in general . What Hartley does best is setting his stories in small situations , focusing on the intimate and idiosyncratic ways in which his characters interact with each other . Since his late 90s and onward , his films have widened in scope in terms of subject matter . Mass media in No Such Thing , Religion in the Book of Life and now Terrorism in Fay Grim . I don't know if Hartley 's talents are suited to such big subject matter or if he 's able to do it justice . Strangely enough , the film can still be reduced to intimate relationships , a simple love story about a woman who goes to seek out the husband she loves . The only problem is , I 've seen Henry Fool and everyone seems incredibly out of character in this film . You can tell this film was written long after Henry Fool was finished without any intention of a sequel . Somehow , the terrorist plot feels conveniently tacked on through the use of Henry 's books of confessions as a macguffin ( in the hitchcockian sense ) . Fay 's motivations for finding Henry seemed motivated purely by the needs of the plot rather than what being faithful to who fay was as person in Henry Fool . I guess I 'm slightly disappointed in the film because it 's not true to the characters in the Henry Fool and it doesn't exactly work as a straight ahead thriller . There 's too much irony and wryness in Hartley 's approach to such as big topic as terrorism . It somehow works and doesn't work at the same time . All I could say , you would either love or hate the film depending on your take on Hartley 's work and how well you know Hartley 's work . Fans of Henry Fool , be severely warned for a disappointment . For the rest , welcome to the world of Hal Hartley and enjoy the ride .  
  Fantastic documentary of 1924 . This early 20th century geography of today 's Iraq was powerful . Watch this and tell me if Cecil B . DeMille didn't take notes before making his The Ten Commandments . Merian C . Cooper , the photographer , later created Cinerama , an idea that probably hatched while filming the remarkable landscapes in this film . Fans of Werner Herzog will find this film to be a treasure , with heartbreaking tales of struggle , complimented by the land around them , never has the human capacity to endure been so evident . The fact that this was made when it was shows not only the will of the subjects , but of the filmmakers themselves .  
  i went to see this movie with a bunch of friends one night . I didn't really hear much about it . So I wasn't expecting anything . But after I saw it , I really liked it . Nicolas Cage and the rest of the cast were very good . But I do have to say Giovanni Ribisi 's acting performace did need a little perking up . But such a small flaw , it could be overrided . Gone In 60 Seconds is about a retired car thief who must boost 60 rare and exotic cars in one night to save his brother 's life . The movie is in no way predictable . So the ending should be a suprise . Think it 's just another , fast car driving movie ? Well you are partially right . There is much more to it . Everyone should take a look at this movie .  
  The cult movie for every true Russian intellectual . Everything is brilliant , especially acting : it 's beyond any praise . The movie , as the book , is full of symbols : my favorite one is the brightest symbol of Razrukha ( colloquial Russian word for " devastation " , often signifies the period of lifestyle chaos after the 1918-20 Civil War ) - the wide-opened dirty door in the bricky wall squeaking in the snowy wind and the pitch-black hole of the doorway behind it . Now the film is released on DVD with fully restored image and the 5.1 sound , there are well-translated English subtitles too , though some obscene words of Sharikov were replaced by the more mild versions in the translation . I don't know is that DVD available abroad but if you 'll find it grab it immediately , it 's really worthy of watching . And , in conclusion , a fact : about the 50 % of Russians today , mostly youth , can be identified as Sharikovs in a considerable degree . It 's the post-Soviet effect : Soviet people appeared to be wholly unprepared for the informational attack of the Western civilization , TV-producers and movie makers have made the entertainment industry and the mass media amazingly aggressive , soulless and thoughtless so that it abetted the darkest instincts of every Russian . Even among the Internet users every third one uses the obscene language in forums and chats because it 's amazingly common in colloquial speech .  
  Well , I come from Bulgaria where it ' s almost impossible to have a tornado but my imagination tells me to be " very , very afraid " ! This guy ( Devon Sawa ) has done a great job with this movie ! I don't know exactly how old he was but he didn't act like a child ( WELL DONE ) ! Now about the tornado-it wasn't very realistic but frightens you ! If you want to have a nice time in front of the telly - this is the movie !  
  Although I really enjoyed Jim Carrey 's latest " serious " performances ( " The Truman Show " , " Man on the Moon " ) , I 've always thought his real genious lies in physical comedy . This is not to say he is a fantastic , talented actor : those bozos at the Academy Awards seem to dislike him so much , he has never had a ( truly deserved ) nomination or award . Well , any " institution " that nominates for 11 Oscars a bore such as " Titanic " shouldn't be taken seriously . On with the review . " The Grinch " is the sweetest , best looking , best acted , more enjoyable seasons film since " The Nightmare before Christmas " . Both movies seem very similar , too , with their highly stylized sets and the premise of someone stealing Christmas . Both make their principal actors seem like the villains ( one in a higher degree than the other ) , both pack a strong moral lesson , and both are truly enjoyable . That is , until you realize that Jack Skellington is a doll , and The Grinch is a human being . But a human being that is so incredibly expressive , so fluid in his movements , so cartoon-like , so unreal , that never gets in the way of the movie . He can be hilarious , he can be a sad soul , he can be angry . He lives in a 3-dimensional world , where 3-dimensional people live . He jokes , he laughs , he cries , and ultimately he saves the Christmas . I loved this film to bits , and cannot wait for it to come out on DVD . This is one of those films you will really enjoy 10 , 20 years from now . As timeless as they come .  
  How The Grinch Stole Christmas instantly stole my heart and became my favorite movie almost from my very first viewing . Now , eight viewings later , it still has the same impact on me as it did the first time I saw it . Screenwriters Jeffery Price & Peter S . Seaman of Who Framed Roger Rabbit fame do a fantastic job of adapting the story of The Grinch to the screen . Ron Howard 's direction brought the story to full life , and Jim Carrey 's typically energetic performance as The Grinch steals the show . Some detractors of the film have claimed that it is not true to the spirit or principles of the original story . Having read the original story , I must say I cannot agree . The movie makes the very same point about Christmas and its true meaning as the original story . Indeed , it enhances the impact of the story by making it more personal by showing us how and why The Grinch became what he was . * MILD SPOILERS * ( They probably wouldn't ruin the movie for you .. but if you haven't seen it yet and you 're one of those who wants to know NOTHING about a story until you 've seen it , you should skip the next two paragraphs . ) I think just about everyone can relate to The Grinch 's terrible experiences in school . I think all of us , at one time or another , were the unpopular one in school who was always picked on . I know I was .. and that 's why I personally had so much sympathy for The Grinch and what he went through . And Cindy Lou Who 's naive idealism , believing that nobody can be all bad , was heart rending . When everyone else had turned their backs on The Grinch out of fear and ignorance , Cindy Lou was determined to be his friend . If only everyone could have such an attitude . In fact , I think the only thing that might 've made the film a little better would have been to further tone down the adult humor and content . It was already pretty restrained , but any of this adult humor ( like when The Grinch slammed nose first into Martha May Whovier 's cleavage ) just doesn't fit in a story like this . This one 's well on its way to being a Christmas classic , taking a richly deserved place alongside the book and the Chuck Jones cartoon as a must-see of every Christmas season .  
  jim carrey rocks ! if he 's in a movie its bound to be good ! he did not disappoint me with this one ! the rest of the cast was cute , especially little cindy lou who and martha may , i was laughing through the whole thing and cannot wait to see it again !  
  I was one of about 200 people that was lucky enough to see an early sneak of this film . Stardust follows Tristan a young man on a quest to find a fallen star and bring it back to the woman he loves in order to prove his love for her . The only catch is that the star has fallen on the other side of the wall , a doorway between England and a magical kingdom known as Stormhold . This film was just a joy to watch , it has something in it for everyone , all of the action scenes are played out beautifully and the comedy is spread out through the film making it funny without being corny . If I had to compare the likes to another film it would probably have to be The Princess Bride , a classic . All the performances are outstanding , the beautiful Claire Danes makes you love her in her portrayal of Yvaine the trusting naive star and under rated Michelle Pfeiffer delivers a stellar over the top performance as Larnia .. but the performance to talk about is Robert De Niro .. In every scene that he is in hands down he steals the show .. If you are in the mood for a funny fantasy love story this is the film . Guys don't get turned off by the description there is enough action comedy and not to mention lots of eye candy with Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer to keep you entertained throughout . The cinematography is dead on and keeps with the feel of the film .. nothing about the film seems forced .  
  I was quite a fan of the series as a child and after that it has always remained in my mind as one of those memorable cartoons that made a difference in the early 80s compared to previous animated series ( Heidi , Barbapapa , Il Etait une Fois l'Homme .. , most of which I love ) . I find that other similar Japanese cartoons of this kind released later can't match Mazinger Z , as they started to boringly repeat the same pattern . That very thing , the novelty , may be one of the best features of Mazinger Z . Another good point is its inventiveness , with so many extravagant monsters , strange devices and bizarre characters ; actually , we were eager to see each new installment to find out what kind of new fiend or evil machine was awaiting us !  
  that kid a is such a babe ; this movie was no Titan A.E. ( of which it is in many ways modeled after ) but still came off as entertaining , the fact this lost to a piece of monkey crap like Tomb raider makes wanna cry ; includes some of the most entertaining characters i 've seen in disney film  
  This movie is so misunderstood it is not even funny . If you think of seeing this one for the shootings .. stay clear . This one deals with the effects and trauma that the survivors must endure . Even the detectives are seeking the answer we all do .. WHY ? Fantastic acting from the two leading ladies as we see how those we ignore are affected by the very same things we are affected with . Yes the language is harsh at times , but it suits the characters well . There are some loose ends left or unanswered , but all movies have these . The major issues are dealt with and this movie makes a major statement about how all of us adults feel after such major incidents . Highly recommended for teens and adults .  
  One of the best " Amitabh comeback " movies I liked . This was the phase when Govinda was going strong with Dhawan . The songs were awesome and totally as we call it " masti " type . An evergreen entertainer with the likes of the multifaceted Anupam Kher chipping in . The story line has a lot of hilarious twists and turns as is known for David Dhawan 's potboilers . With a timely appearance by Mrs . Madhuri " Nene " Dixit , it was a total riot towards the end . It was great to see Amit perform with such force and humor after a long exile . Although some may consider it a typical " Bollywood Masala " movie , I would watch it any day . I am giving it an easy 8 out of 10 just for being pure Bollywood .  
  The line , of course , is from the Lord 's Prayer - " Thy Will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven " . Sweden , especially its far north , is not my idea of heaven - 30 degree C winter temperatures are a little on the low side for me , but the good folk who live there no doubt think they are in God 's own country . The storyline here is a familiar one . Acclaimed international musician Daniel suffers health breakdown in mid-career , goes back to the little village in northern Sweden where he was born . Persuaded by the local pastor to help out with the church choir , he turns some unlikely talent into a class act , and they enter a contest held in Innsbruck Austria . There are echoes ( sorry ) of the band players of " Brassed Off " the models of " Calendar Girls " and the dancers of " the Full Monty " . But of course he causes plenty of emotional upheaval as some of the more downtrodden villagers realise their worth and revolt against their oppressors . He faces hostile husbands and an increasingly dubious pastor , but nothing except death is going to stop him . Despite the somewhat corny story , we get to know and like many of the characters , who come across as people rather than caricatures despite many of them being recognisable " types ' . I did wonder about the wife-beater being unpunished for so long  Sweden is one country in the world where such violence is pretty strongly discouraged ( he was also a bit young to be one of the bullies of Daniel 's youth ) and the puritanical pastor with a secret passion for girlie magazines was a bit of a stereotype , but marvellously realised by Niklas Falk . Michael Nyqvist is simply wonderful as Daniel , the frail but driven musician , and there 's some nice music as well . I was rapt for the whole two hours . The ending is what you make of it , I guess , but it 's not spoiling it to say Daniel achieves what he set out to do .  
  ' Five Days ' is billed as something special , a crime drama that consists of a series of episodes , each set on one particular day of a police enquiry . But in fact , this element of the story turns out to be rather less significant than might at first be thought , as the fact that the action in each episode is confined to 24 hours is hardly noticeable , and very little distinguishes the program from countless other crime stories . In fact one almost can't help drawing comparisons to the last ' Prime Suspect ' , as one of the sub-plots focuses on a single , cynical female cop approaching retirement : and it 's not just the absence of Helen Mirren that makes the comparisons unfavourable . There 's a lot of earnest over-emoting , manipulative music and a set of characters seemingly contrived so that each one is in some sense sympathetic , in another suspicious . And it 's possible to guess the guilty party well before the end , not because of the internal dynamic of the story , but rather because of the construction of the drama as a whole : certain things must be true , to justify the way that the series focuses on certain characters at certain times . In spite of these failings , the series grew on me : by the end , I was quite gripped . But it 's a sad sign that the BBC , which once made the likes of ' The Singing Detective ' , boasted of this of " possibly the best drama of the year " : for there 's little true originality on offer here , and the claim reveals a lack of ambition that is dreadfully disappointing . ' Five Days ' is in fact not rubbish ; but it is formulaic , and one would hope that the very best the BBC had to offer would be something a little more innovative and fresh .  
  I am not a very good writer , so I 'll keep this short . World at War is the best WWII documentary that I 've seen . I 've seen different WWII documentaries ( not only English / North American ) and this documentary seems to be the most complete WWII documentary that I 've seen . I think it could talk a bit more about the Great Depression and why / how Hitler got to power , but it does a very good job at covering the war . It seems to be complete and objective / fair to everyone . It does not exaggerate or diminish roles of different nations . It has a lot of original footage , including color footage and many eye witnesses ( it was made in 70 's when a lot more were alive ) . It has great music and narrator . All-in-All I gave this one 10/10 , because it 's that good . ( I haven't seen specials in DVD version so I cannot comment on those )  
  To Be Honost With you i think everything was so good in this movie there should be no reason why it didn't go into theaters , The Deaths in the movie are awesome the fx are awesome when used , There are a few dull moments when the story 's following the little girl but all in all this was a very good movie that i hope someday get 's the props it should . The very first part of the movie is prob why it came straight to video with them killing a little boy but after that the story is based on a little girl and her mother who came to visit the moms boyfriend who moved out to try to become a writer , The property he buy 's turns out to be where the Witch ( Tooth Fairy ) lives and anyone who live in her house or goes on her property will be in great danger don't wanna give anything really away just a little info if you 've wanted to see this movie then do so it 's worth the price of the rental  
  This movie has great stars in their earlier years : Ingor Stevens never looked prettier ; Yul Brynner was a very convincing Jean LaFitte , conflicted about his piracy and desiring to keep neutrality with the United States . Charlton Heston did a pretty good job as Andrew Jackson , but some moments were a bit stilted . It 's really a good flick for students to learn that part of our history , AND it shows that all happy endings do NOT include the lovers getting together with each other-sometimes the happier ending is that they sail away and find partners of similar background who will understand them better in the long run . I have viewed it every year at least twice for 16 years now ; and though it is not the best movie I 've ever seen , I love it every time !  
  Look , if I were interested in a Nancy Drew book , what I would do is pick up a book and read it . I 'm not . Ever since I can remember I read people trashing movies because it wasn't like the book . I 'm sorry - in the digital age we can no longer watch movies on flip books , however I 'm sure you can still find a few short silent films in book form . When Lord of the Rings came out , people complained . When the third one won an Oscar - " The book was better . " When I watched To Kill a Mockingbird , " the book was better . " Now a bunch of people are upset , yet again , because Nancy Drew wasn't like the book . I 'm not saying Nancy Drew is going to win any Oscars - if anything it 'll be one of those Nickelodeon Blimps or Kids Choice Awards . I 'm saying give film a break . It 's film , not paper . As a movie , I found Nancy Drew quite enjoyable - featuring cameos from Bruce Willis and Adam Goldberg ( The Hebrew Hammer ) and supporting roles featuring Tate Donovan ( Jimmy Cooper on the O.C. ) and Rachel Leigh Cook ( She 's All That ) . This is the first time I 've seen Emma Roberts in a movie and , frankly , I enjoy her work more than most of Julia and of Eric 's ; her character stays consistent throughout the film and reacts well with conflict . A lighthearted movie in the spirit of Harriet the Spy is nice now and again . I give it ten stars because I thoroughly enjoyed the movie , would love to see it again , and will probably buy it upon DVD release .  
  2054 . Paris is an Escher drawing with people and vehicles scurrying along at multiple levels in an obvious homage to Fritz Lang 's Metropolis . Paris is both ultramodern and crumbling into decay . And in the blink between surveillance sweeps , a pretty young medical researcher is kidnapped just after leaving her sister in a seedy nightclub . A tough police captain investigates . Shown in stark black and white , with the gloomy corridors , shadowy alleys and single source lighting characteristic of the most hard-boiled of film noir , comparisons to Sin City are inevitable . But the story owes more to Masamune Shirow and William Gibson than to Frank Miller , as high tech surveillance , near-invisible stealth suits and ruthless super-corporations are as much a part of the landscape as guns and cars . The film never quite generates the doom-laden atmosphere of Gibson 's cyberpunk vision , with its tech-heavy marginal characters clashing with industrial types from corporations that all seem to have their own Ministry of Fear , but the viewer definitely gets the sense that future Paris is no Utopia and future science is less than benevolent . And as the police procedural plot line unfolds we are taken into the darker recesses of individual ambition beneath the shiny veneer of Avalon corporation 's cultivated PR image . The motion capture process used here produces a look somewhere between B & W comic books and next generation rotoscoping , and is either captivating or intrusive depending on your tastes . Nevertheless , a great visual sense is on display here , and future Paris is filled in down to the tiny details giving the picture a unique look which is in turns both spartan and baroque . Worth a look .  
  Time for Hollywood to sit up and take notice ! If the actors are acting snooty , all you need to do is get the animators who worked on this little marvel . Renaissance is probably the first animation flick which makes you forget that you are not seeing human beings . Although the voice overs by the cast ( Craig , McCormack , Pryce etc . ) are some of the best i have ever heard but even then the emotions portrayed by the ' cartoons ' are unnerving . This style of animation is not very new but the use of light and shadows makes the movie a living painting . Ironically , such technical wizardry makes you forget that this is actually a very very nice movie . The pacing and plot development are marvelous and the dialogs crisp . Plot : Disappearance of a mega corporation 's top employee unravels a tale of deceit and corruption with a Cold hearted hero at the helm . Can't say much without giving it all away .. except that while the movie keeps you at the edge of your seat , the climax leaves you speechless . A must watch .. even for the ' grown-ups ' who smirk at ' cartoons '  
  Mahatma has been depicted as a man who neglected his own son in this movie . Don't get me wrong I am not condemning the movie ; it is such a wonderful movie and walked out of the cinema with a lump in my throat . We need to understand Mahatma 's spiritual standing , he is a true spiritual leader . Only a fully enlightened man could possibly detach himself from his loved ones . A man with such caliber leads his family and followers by example . According to the movie , he spoke to his son and try to make him understand where he is coming from , but poor Harilall with so little intellect could not understand his father . When things went wrong with Harilall , Mahatma could remain calm and accepted that his son is a big tragedy . Had it been any other parents , they would have compromised their values to assist the son to get on his feet . Mahatma didn't do that , he is true leader who leads by example .  
  Spoilers I loved the later episodes from college and on , but I wish I could get the last season on DVD . Unfortunately , the latest I could get is the first college season . Still the teenage years were sweet ; although they focused a lot on magic , they also made her into a character that teens could relate to , deeling with the stuggles of teens , and children in divorced families . This show was very innocent ; they did not get into the morbid teenage problems such as sex and drugs , but they did deel with pressure to fit in . I loved watching her grow up and cope with her magic on her own and trying to convince her Aunts to let go as she left the nest . The older episodes were cute , but it was just so much better to see her as ( well not really a teenage witch anymore ) but an adult witch . I loved Roxy and Mortgan ; they were so talented ! In the earlier episodes the Aunts were great actresses , but they were so strict , kind and loving , but they treated her like a young child in some ways , but not in every way . I mean they grounded her for every little mistake she made with her magic , I mean let her learn from her own mistakes for once ! That was what I liked about the college episodes ; she was able to learn from her own mistakes without be grounded over everything ; that was annoying . Not to put down Hilda and Zelda . Melissa Joan Hard is beautiful and was perfect for the Sabrina with her Perky personality . I liked the last episode where she ran off the marry Harvey , but as somebody else said , it would have been nice to see what happened after . I mean I believe it was obvious they were getting married ; where else would they be running off to in her wedding dress ? But I would have liked to have seen it . I supposed they wanted to leave it up to the viewer to choose the ending though rather than spoon feeding it to us as most comedies do . Somebody said they could have shown them marry and go to school in the house , but they already graduated college . Sabrina had great job for a magazine and I think Harvey had a good job , because he lived in a nice apartment that we only see at the end , but they never say what he does . As a child they always talk about how he does not want to be an exterminator like his Dad . When Sabrian moved into the house that season , they never really explain how it happened . Actually , there is a lot the show does not explain , but I supposed it is supposed to be to leave it up to us and give it some mystery . Prior to Sabrina and her friends moving into the house , they show Hilda getting married and this whole spell that ends up with Zelda turning into a child . Hilda comes back in the last episode ( and Zelda is there in some other form , but Beth is not on the episode ) but they do not show Zelda 's husband or what happened , like did they have children ? Maybe they didn't want too much going on in one episode . I also liked Hart 's sister who played her spoiled cousin ! She was pretty and a great actress and it was interesting to see her grown up ! I cannon believe it has been six years since the show went off the air ! I still love the reruns ! Also , I don't know if anybody noticed this , but in the earlier episodes , the town was called Westbridbe ( a made up town I believe , which was supposed to be close to Salem ) but in the later episodes , they don't mention the name of the town being caled Westbridge and I think they call it Boston , unless that is just where she worked . Also , I wanted to add , I found the episode , " Wild Wild Sabrina " where she is taught about the importance of rules , to be insulting . She was 18 and too old to be grounded ; I would have been insulted if my parents grounded me at 18 . And I think while an 18 year old might mess up how she did , they need to learn the consequences on their own . I think at 18 they know rules are important .  
  Otto Preminger 's noir classic works almost as a flip-side of LAURA .. while that film was glitzy and features the high fa-luting Clifton Webb , this film is a whole lot seamier . Dana Andrews is a less than good cop who accidentally kills a man only to have it potentially pinned on the father of the girl he loves . Preminger keeps things moving at a brisk clip so that lapses in logic are easily overlooked . Andrews is quite fine ( a lot less wooden than he 's been in the past ) and the stunningly beautiful Gene Tierney is stunningly beautiful ! Creepy Craig Stevens plays the unlucky victim . WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS is a must see and a terrific companion-piece to Preminger 's equally lurid WHIRLPOOL ( also starring Tierney ) .  
  Some bad reviews here for this and I understand why but treat it as a low budget serial killer film and you might get more from it than most . I thought that this worked in a way because afterwards I felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower so that is some degree of success isn't it ? I would say there is just the right level of sleaze here to get under your skin although the acting is maybe a bit too uneven . David Hess is only in this brielfy so don not get your hopes up to much if you like Last House . Other than that - worth a look .  
  I only know of one other movie that could possibly compete with Opening Night and that 's Bergman ' ; s Persona . Both movies are simply amazing , they have a richness of ideas hard to grasp at first sight . We have a profound meditation on the relation of art and life as one actress , Myrtle Gordon ( Gena Rowlands ) , finds herself more in touch with the character she is playing on stage than she would want to . The accidental death of one of her fans , a young girl that declares her love for Myrtle and she is then hit by a car , leaves a deep mark in the actress . She starts asking herself question related to her aging that starts to affect her until the only solution becomes alcohol . But that doesn't help to much and Myrtle is one step away from complete madness . The scene where she kill the imaginary ( or not ) spirit of the dead girl is one of the most thrilling scenes I found in a Cassavets film . The movie ends with a display of genius on behalf of the director as he films a theater scene where he himself and Gena Rowlands improvise a scene , since Myrtle comes too drunk to the opening night to perform her part accurately . This scene was filmed spontaneously , with a live audience , the laughter is genuine , the chemistry between Casavates and Rowlands absolutely amazing . If you liked Persona or are interested in a movie that offers substantial ideas alongside great entertainment this movie will suit you just fine .  
  Let 's go straight to the point : this is The Movie I would take with me on a desert island ( with dvd player ) . It 's just perfect . If a reason for you to see a movie is that you love the actors , you like to see them free to involve in the space and feelings , this movie is for you . See the scene when Myrtle ( Rowlands ) come on stage drunk and Maurice ( Cassavetes ) has to improvise because she doesn't follow the script anymore . If you 're sensitive to the camera 's movements , you 'll be fascinated by the way the camera moves on stage , the particular flow , that give you the impression camera follow the actors as if it was lead by the theatrical principle of " private space " .. amazing . And the story is just a brilliant mix of tale and realistic drama . Cassavetes is again arguing with Hollywood and the majors ' politics , but this time , he do it through Broadway , making one of the most exciting movie about theater . Well , this movie is a bliss .  
  i just finished watching Dressed to Kill , which is written and directed by Brian De Palma . the DVD had both the " R " rated version and the unrated version . i chose the unrated version . since i have yet to view the " R " rated version , i can't be completely sure of the difference . there is however a very graphic graphic female nudity including a scene of explicit expression of self gratification in this version . i guess you could call this scene soft core porn . if this sort of thing may offend you , i would suggest you view the " R " rated version . but i digress . Any comment from here on refers to the unrated version . this is a murder mystery / psychological horror / suspense movie . there is very little violence and blood . there is however one death sequence of note . the act of the killing itself is fairly graphic . however the blood it self does not look real . it is reminiscent of how a 70 's slasher film would look . i believe this is done deliberately to offset the violence of the act itself , to give the scene a low budget feel . most of the violence , or rather possibility of such , is implied . the film is very well paced . as far as i can tell every scene had a purpose , which i find very rare when compared to many of today 's films . anyway , i also thought the acting was good , especially Angie Dickinson . and Micheal Cane turns in a quietly understated performance in his role , which works brilliantly in this case . the movie also has one great twist in it , in my mind , although some people might find it predictable . the only complaint ( and it 's really more of an observation ) i have is that i thought the character played by Nancy Allen could have been fleshed out more , especially considering she has a fair amount of screen time . but i think she does a good job with what she is given . and this doesn't really take away from the quality of the film . the film also has a strong moral to it , which is even more relevant today . but the movie doesn't hit you over the head with it . i also really liked the musical score , composed by Pino Dinaggioi felt it was very similar to the music in the original Psycho . to me , this music really elevated the movie . i thought this movie was brilliant . for me , Dressed to Kill ( 1980 ) is 10/10  
  I grew up watching this series . I was about seven / eight years old when it was on . I still remember the 1st episode which was called " The New House . " It scared the h * ll out of me ! I can almost still hear that statue , laughing madly . And the ending , oh my God ! The hooror spirit comes in the room for the child : Yikes ! This was classic TV and it was a one of a kind series . I have found a DVD collection for sale on the internet : 2 actually . My question to any readers : Has anyone purchased this set ? Its a bootleg . Both sellers claim to have very good copy . I have a sketchy and poor DVD of " The New House " episode , and a couple of other episodes that are a bit better , however , if anyone knows if these are much clearer it would be worth it to me to buy and share with my kids . A great series , clever , scary and daringly supernatural . Thanks in advance to any fans who have the low down on any of this - In fact , I 'd love to discuss it . Chris Walker  
  * Possible spoilers * There is only one reason why I saw this movie and that was because I have a massive crush on Richard Belzer . ( I don't know that much about humor ) There were some part that were funny Like the Barbie and Ken Spoof and the dealers and the president skit . Mind you this is sometimes raunchy ( Dare , I say crude ? ) It was at times funny , but it could have been better . Probably if they spent more time in the humor and less time getting women undress , the movie would had been funnier . Some skits just make you want to gag , and cringe , others skits make you laugh and oddly enough think . Sadly this movie is dated . If you have a mad crush on Richard Belzer ( So worth it ) it 's worth checking it out and seeing chevy chase .  
  I was born in 1982 . Most of my childhood memories are in the extreme late 80 's and 90 's . I watched the Groove Tube for the first time in 2001 , when I was 19 . And I found it hilarious . So for anybody who thinks that something " dated " can't be quite funny 30 years later .. think again ! It 's funny even if you have no idea what the 70 's were like , and the thought of bell-bottom pants make you cringe . Who can argue with a Bozo the Clown type who reads adult literature ? There is plenty to laugh at . The scrotal puppet show at the end is the best .  
  This little-appreciated movie is one of my favorites . I can watch it over and over . Dreyfus and Braga are masterful , but Raul Julia steals the show ! A tongue-in-cheek , menacingly humorous Gomez Addams , with just the right tone for this irreverent spoof of this oft-told story . Generally untrumpeted and unappreciated , Moon Over Parador allows you to check out of reality and join the fun going on up on the screen . Two thumbs up !  
  Textbook example of an underestimated movie . Although one can watch this movie over and over again and laugh every single time and still see something new in it , it 's still regarded as just another funny picture . And although the movie has inspired many and added it 's quotes and images to the pyche of all it 's viewers , Moon Over Parador still hasn't received the acclaim it should . Even the brilliant cast with Academy Award winner Richard Dreyfuss and Raul Julia , to mention one , is not able to change this perception . But after watching Raul Julia as Roberto Strausmann make Richard Dreyfus an offer he can't refuse in a meatlocker by reading him a good review of a part that he once played one can only come to one conclusion : this stuff is timeless ! In fifty years we will have the proof .  
  This is a story of the Winchester Rifle Model 1873 " The Gun That Won The West " To cowman , outlaw , peace officer or soldier , the Winchester 73 was a treasured possession . An Indian would sell his soul to own one .. Winchester 73 is the first collaboration between director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart , a duo that would go on to create a run of superior Westerns that added a new , psychological depth to the genre . The story sees Stewart as Lin McAdam pursuing the man who killed his father . Riding into Dodge City with his trusty friend , Johnny Williams { Millard Mitchell } , Lin runs into Dutch Henry Brown { Stephen McNally } , the man he wants . But with Wyatt Earp { Will Geer } having taken all the guns from those entering the town , both men are unable to have the shoot-out that they are ready for . The men instead square up in a competition to win a Winchester 73 rifle , a competition that Lin eventually wins . But before he can leave town with the magnificent prize , Dutch ambushes him , steals the rifle and skips town fast . As Lin sets off in hate filled pursuit of both man and rifle , the rifle will changed hands a number of times , with each time adding another dimension as the day of reckoning for all approaches . Very much a benchmark for what became known as the so-called " psychological Western " , Winchester 73 is basically a story of a decent man driven to borderline insanity by an event in his past . Tho shot in black and white { the only one of the duos Westerns that was } the landscapes are still breathtaking feasts for the eyes . The tone is set with the opening scene as Lin and Johnny on horseback , and in silhouette , amble over a hillside as they make their way to Dodge City . It 's just the starting point that would see Mann use his vistas as a way of running concurrent with his characters emotional states . Stewart gives one of his finest and most intense performances as McAdam , proving once and for all that he was one of Americas finest and most versatile actors . The support cast isn't too bad either . Shelley Winters is excellent as the sole female in amongst the machismo , while Mitchell , McNally , Geer and the always great Dan Duryea add further class to proceedings . There 's even bit parts for Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson in here , tho the latter playing an Indian brave is a stretch too far . Originally the film was a project for Fritz Lang , who even had the script ready to run . But Lang walked away from it , something that proved to be a blessing for Western fans . For as great as a director that Lang was , with Mann directing { and with a new script from Borden Chase & Robert Richards in hands } it set the wheels in motion to alter the course of the genre . Not only with the further efforts that Mann & Stewart produced , but also in who they influenced . The likes of Budd Boetticher , Nicholas Ray and Sam Fuller were all taking notes , and gleefully for the Western purists , they followed suit and carried the psychological torch still further . A big hit at the box office back on release , Winchester 73 is a magnificent film that still packs a punch in the modern age . 9.5/10  
  CONTAINS SPOILER With the possible exception of John Wayne , no other actor sat taller in the saddle in Westerns than James Stewart , and this movie proves it . This superb tale of revenge centered around a Winchester rifle , has only one weak spot I can think of : the casting of Will Geer as a very unEarp-like Wyatt Earp . The casting of the villains was good : Stephen McNally , as surly Dutch Henry , Dan Duryea as Waco Johnny Dean , and John McIntire ( versatile at playing both good guys and bad guys ) as a slick gun runner . The showdown between Stewart and McNally on the cliffs is great ! I 'd stack this Western against the whole crop of Westerns made today . They wouldn't stand a chance !  
  This movie was one of the funniest movie I 've seen in years and the laughs from the audience members support me . Not since My Big Fat Greek Wedding ( 2002 ) has the laughter been as spontaneous and intense . Easily has intricate as last year 's Mr . and Mrs . Smith ( 2005 ) in its use of parody ( espionage in Mr . and Mrs . Smith and sex in My Super Ex-Girlfriend ) . Director 's Ivan Reitman balance between comedy and drama , between crazy and downright ludicrous is great . Never does the shock and dramatic serious crack the rule of comedy . At the same time , this predictable romantic comedy never loses its touching emotional elements even if the ending is broadcast in advance . In some ways , it 's so evident that it 's great to see how it plays out . Just like in real life , sometimes the truth is so evident that one can't really see it . Easily eight out of ten stars ranking up there with Tootsie ( 1982 ) . Possibly a nine ( depends on how it appears on a second viewing ) .  
  Haunted by a secret , Ben Thomas ( Will Smith ) looks for redemption by radically transforming the lives of seven people he doesn't know . Once his plan is set , nothing will be able to stop him . At least that 's what he thinks . But Ben hadn't planned on falling in love with one of these people and she 's the one who will end up transforming him . Will Smith is back again with Director Gabriele Muccino , after the life inspiring movie " The Pursuit of Happiness " . " Seven Pounds " is yet another life changing movie experience , which not only does reminds you of their previous collaboration , tearful , but inspires you joyfully in the end . Will Smith , also is the producer again with some of the others . These movies are very realistic , which depicts a common man 's life & his struggles through life . Seven Pounds might have took some time to gain it 's actual momentum , but just after half an hour of the movie , the movie is all set to rule your heart . Also , this movie has some twists revolving around , which lets the viewers keep guessing . Director Gabriele Muccino once again is the winner all the way , with his emotional yet inspiring message . He makes all the characters of the movie very real , that the people would actually find themselves in somewhere of the movie . Along with the director , Will Smith is yet another winner , with his superb acting skills . Once again , the duo of the director & the actor works as a charm . Also , there are other talented actors in the movie who did their part pretty well . Rosario Dawson , beauty with brains , that 's what she can be called . She looks beautiful & does her part extremely well . Barry Pepper , gives a great support to the movie & Woody Harrelson does the same , although Woody did not had much screen timing ( would have been good if he had more ) . You won't forget this movie easily . Watch this movie & change your life . Top class cinema !  
  An Insomniac 's Nightmare was an incredibly interesting , well-made film . I loved the way it just throws you into the main character 's subconscious without coddling the viewer .. the acting was top notch - honestly , I would watch Dominic Monaghan read the phone book ! - but everyone else , especially the young girl , was great as well . I was very impressed by the look of the film , too . Usually , " independent films " have a grainy , I shot this on my camcorder look to them , but this director knows what she 's doing . The lighting , the cinematography .. quality work . I 'm looking forward to a feature-length work from Tess Nanavati !  
  You spend most of this two-hour film wondering " what 's the story regarding the lead character ? " Will Smith , as a low-key " Ben Thomas " will keep you guessing . The last 20-25 minutes is when you find out , and it 's a shocker .. but you knew something dramatic was going to be revealed . Until then , Smith , plays it mysterious , almost stalking people . You know he has a good reason for doing it , but it 's never really explained , once again , to keep us guessing until the end . All of it , including a on again / off again but touching romance with Rosario Dawkins ( " Emily Posa " ) might make some viewers frustrated or wanting to quit this film .. but don't because the final long segment puts all the pieces of this puzzle together . This is a two-hour film and not the typical action-packed macho Will Smith film . In fact , the most shocking aspect might be seeing the drawn , sad face of Smith throughout this story . It almost doesn't even look like him in a number of shots . He looks like he 's lost weight and is sick . Smith does a great job portraying a man carrying around a lot of sadness . Like a good movie will often do , this film will leave you thinking long after the ending credits .  
  In this satire of the commercialization and ' lightheartedness ' of war , John Cusack plays Brand Hauser , an assassin sent to to ' Turaqistan ' to take out Omar Sharif , who is doing some oil business that will spell trouble for the former Vice President of the US 's own company . In addition to this , Hauser must juggle his fake position as a trade show producer , a wedding for pop princess Yonica ( Hillary Duff ) , and a nosy Liberal journalist , Natalie ( Marisa Tomei ) . Assessing the technical aspects : - The acting ( by the main characters , at least ) was good , as was to be expected . Some of John Cusack 's dialogue was quite obviously not written for him as he often seemed uncomfortable saying it . . . maybe unrealistic is more accurate . Joan put forth a great , and often hilarious , performance . Marisa Tomei , while I 've never been a big fan of hers , was more than suitable for the role and worked well . Hillary Duff , however , was pretty terrible . They needed an attractive Middle Eastern ( or Russian , or whatever that accent was supposed to be ) pop-star . Unfortunately , they went 0 for 3 with her . - Like I said above , the writing seemed a little stiff and mismatched at points , especially John Cusack 's dialogue . Not much of it , mind , but some . The story also got a bit ludicrous at points , which is fine for a satire to a point , but it took it to a whole new level here . Luckily , the Cusacks and Tomei keep a relatively cool , calm demeanor throughout , and that makes a nice even mix of the craziness of the film and the levelheadedness of the actors . - Joshua Seftel , who previously had a drought of real credits to his name , did a fine job with a rather wide-spectrum film . He handled the small ( $ 10 million ) budget very well , stretching it to make it appear to be much more . Seftel also managed to nicely blend the humour of the story . . . with the painful and hard-to-watch parts of the real war ( including slaughter of civilians , etc . ) . - As far as the general satire goes , its exaggerated look on the commercializing of war is very well done , especially the ' Golden Palace Poker ' ads on the U.S. tanks . At points , it becomes a little too much , but , in the end , it still accurate portrays what it 's going for an a young ' Mel Brooks'-type of style . Overall , the film is very well made for the meager budget and it 's definitely worthy of a look . It won't go down as one of the great satires of cinema , but it 's certainly not the worst . 7/10 .  
  I was shocked and surprised by the negative reviews I saw on the web , I thought Cinderella 2 ( as well as 3 ) is a very cute and funny sequel for everyone - kids and adults .. like me , I am 22 years old . I also find it and very informative film , it shows lessons on being true to yourself and following your heart . I thought it has great animation , and the voice casting was very good ; the songs performed by Brooke Allison too . Since this film has been divided into three flashbacks / stories , my favorite out of the three , is the story of when Jaq the mouse , became a human for a day , thanks to Fairy Godmother and her magic .  
  Terry Gilliam traveled again to the future ( he had already done it in " Brazil " ) to tell this story about a virus that 's destroying the human race . The script is totally crazy with some easy tricks on it but it 's quite entertaining and Gilliam proves that he 's got imagination ( the futuristic scenes are just great ) . As for the cast , Bruce Willis and the beautiful Madeleine Stowe ( whatever happened to her ? ) are just OK , but Brad Pitt is so annoying , whenever he plays roles that are out of his hand he results so forced and he 's not credible at all . He should just play good-looking successful young men . * My rate : 7/10  
  A heartwarming film . The usual superb acting by John Thaw , who passed over recently . A man who was always so unassuming . He was one of Englands top 10 actors certainly of my time . He can be remembered for his famous role of Inspector Morse . As Jack Regan in the 1970 's hit TV series ' the Sweeney and as a barrister in Kavanah QC . A must see for all the family and a great DVD for my collection . The filming will bring back a few memories for people who remember wartime Britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of London to escape the German bombings . The interaction between the two main characters . Tom and the boy William was really well acted and true to the book by Michelle Magorian .  
  Reed Hadley makes a better foppish Don Diego than he does a dashing and daring Zorro , but that 's almost beside the point because this serial features the bar-none best theme song of any serial , ever - and the best version of Yakima Canutt 's famous stagecoach stunt . There are other good stunts , and lots of action , and plenty of hair-raising cliff-hanger chapter endings , but if for no other reason , you must see this film to watch the stagecoach stunt , then re-watch it in slow motion . It is incredible , and , despite the lower budget for this chapter play , Yak turns in a better take on the stunt here than he did in the far more celebrated film " Stagecoach . " Indiana Jones , eat your heart out : This is the real deal !  
  There have been several films about Zorro , some even made in Europe , e . g . Alain Delon . This role has also been played by outstanding actors , such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins , but to me the best of all times has always been Reed Hadley . This serial gives you the opportunity to see an interesting western , where you will only discover the real villain , Don del Oro , at its end . The serial also has good performance of various actors of movies B like Ed Cobb , ex - Tarzan Jim Pierce , C . Montague Shaw , eternal villains like John Merton and Charles King , and a very good performance of Hadley as Zorro . He was quick , smart , used well his whip and sword , and his voice was the best for any Zorro .  
  Ira Levin 's Deathtrap is one of those mystery films in the tradition of Sleuth that would be very easy to spoil given any real examination of the plot of the film . Therefore I will be brief in saying it concerns a play , one man who is a famous mystery playwright , another man who is a promising writer , the playwright 's wife who is much younger and sexier than the role should have been , and one German psychic along for the ride . Director Sidney Lumet , no stranger to film , is quite good for the most part in creating the tension the film needs to motor on . The dialog is quick , fresh , and witty . Michael Caine excels in roles like these . Christopher Reeve is serviceable and actually grows on you the more you see him act . Irene Worth stands out as the funny psychic . How about Dyan Cannon ? Love how Lumet packaged her posterior in those real tight-fitting pants and had her wear possibly the snuggest tops around , but she is terribly miscast in this role - a role which should have been given to an older actress and one certainly less seductive . But why quibble with an obvious attempt to bribe its male viewers when nothing will change it now ? Deathtrap is funny , sophisticated , witty , and classy . The mystery has some glaring flaws which do detract somewhat , and I was not wholly satisfied with the ending , but watching Caine and Reeve under Lumet 's direction with Levin 's elevated verbiage was enough to ensnare my interest and keep it captive the entire length of the film .  
  Paul Lukas played a Russian intellectual making his living as a waiter in " Grand Slam , " directed by William Dieterle ( 1933 ) . It is a surprisingly funny satire of the building up of celebrity . The waiter and the Russian restaurant 's hat-check girl played by Loretta Young become America 's sweethearts as bridge partners who do no squabble . With the aid of publicist and ghost-writer ' Speed ' McCann ( the wonderfully deadpan Frank McHugh ) they become walking advertisements for the " Stanislavsky system , " a " system " of bidding whatever one feels like ( since bids are not rational , there is no basis for recriminations about their stupidity ) . A duel with displaced bridge guru Cedric Van Dorn ( sounds close to Goren , no ? and I suspect the choice of the character 's name " Stanislavsky " was also a slam at another kind of system ) , a puffed-up charlatan played very well by Ferdinand Gottschalk , is broadcast on radio stations across America like a prize-fight by Roscoe Karns ( another great fast-talking deadpan comic actor of the 1930s ) . The bridge players are even in a roped-off square , though the audience is above them , unlike in boxing " rings . " The wide variety of American types prefigures the comedies of Preston Sturges , though for manufacturing celebrity , " Grand Slam " most calls to mind two better movies from the same ( pre-Code ) era with Lee Tracy playing fast-talking publicists : " The Half-Naked Truth " and " Bombshell , " but " Grand Slam " has its moments , especially for anyone who has played bridge with serious point counters . Loretta Young was already a clothes horse . ( To me , her face seems a bit long and horsey , too . Another era 's notion of beauty , I guess .. ) The movie unfortunately all but drops Glenda Farrell , who plays McHugh 's forgetful girlfriend .  
  Curly Sue is a 6 year old with an abundance of hair and a life as a drifter . She and her father , Bill ( Jim Belushi ) , try to survive on the streets by being small time con artists . In Chicago , Bill decides to jump in front of a car in a pricey parking garage while Curly will scream about lawsuits and traction to the intended victim . It happens to be a very upscale lawyer named Grey ( Kelly Lynch ) who is appropriately appalled at what she has done . Not only do the scammers make some cash , they get to spend the night at Grey 's plush apartment . Even then , Grey feels she owes them more so the three of them hang together for a spell . Grey only knows the lucrative law business and nothing about life . Who better to teach her than Bill and Curly , those savvy experts on life 's realities ? But , all good things must come to an end and there is no life for a legal expert and a couple of con men . Or is there ? This is a sweet and funny movie about the unexpected . Curly is certainly as entertaining as Shirley Temple but much edgier , of course . Belushi gives a rare touching performance as the down on his luck con and Lynch is luminous as the snooty but soft touch lawyer . John Hughes , as writer and director , shows us his magic touch once again , as the script is lively and unpredictable . Just watch Curly and Bill take Grey out for a night , with no money , and see the humorous results . Do you long for happy endings , long promised and finally delivered , with a few uncertain moments in between ? This is your made-to-order movie .  
  With all thats going on in the world sometimes we need an escape . Curly Sue is just that . Not a complicated plot or deep meaning ; however it is not devoid of substance . There is more than furious action or heart pounding dramas . There are the charming little shows you can watch with your kids and have enough substance to enjoy with your date . Try it you may like it more than you think . The little girl is really smart and cute . The " Dad " and the girl go thru some slapstick routines . When a jealous boyfriend steps in , trouble brews for Curly and the life shes known may be torn asunder . Fred Thompson and Kelly Lynch play good roles as the upper crust and Alison Porter and James Belushi are a interesting fable like duo portraying street wise homeless drifters . Their worlds collide and comedy ensues .  
  I first saw this movie on a local station on the Sunday afternoon horror show back around 1969 or 1970 . Uncut . I was just a little kid at the time , but I loved it and wasn't really that scared by it . I thought it had such a cool and highly original storyline . Thinking back , I 'm still surprised that it was shown during the day on T.V. uncut in those years . I 've sought out this film ever since , seen it over and over again , and always loved it . One would think John Waters would have idolized this film . It 's got to be not only a scary film , but one of the sleaziest , trashiest films ever made at that time . And surprisingly , you don't hear about this one as having the cult following that a movie such as " Blood Feast " or " The Hills Have Eyes " have acquired over the years . It has a cult following , but it should have really become a cult classic , in my opinion . As far as I know , this came out a little before Blood Feast came out , making this probably one of the first true " gore " films . In fact , this movie has elements of Hershell Gordon Lewis AND a little Russ Meyer thrown in for good measure . Anyway , I recommend this for anyone who likes trashy , sleazy , black and white horror films from the early ' 60 's ( I think the date at the end of it read 1960 ) .  
  There is no relation at all between Fortier and Profiler but the fact that both are police series about violent crimes . Profiler looks crispy , Fortier looks classic . Profiler plots are quite simple . Fortier 's plot are far more complicated .. Fortier looks more like Prime Suspect , if we have to spot similarities .. The main character is weak and weirdo , but have " clairvoyance " . People like to compare , to judge , to evaluate . How about just enjoying ? Funny thing too , people writing Fortier looks American but , on the other hand , arguing they prefer American series ( ! ) . Maybe it 's the language , or the spirit , but I think this series is more English than American . By the way , the actors are really good and funny . The acting is not superficial at all ..  
  When I heard about " Hammerhead " being released on DVD and finally found it at my local DVD store , I thought " well , just another cheap monster movie from Nu Image " . Those guys around Boaz Davidson and Avi Lerner produced cheap but very entertaining B - Pictures in the past few months but also some very disappointing movies . So I didn't expect much , especially after having watched the rather disappointing " Shark Zone " just a few days before . But " Hammerhead " turned out to be an excellent revival of the 1950s monster movies . We have a mad scientist , a group of people in a dangerous situation , screaming women and damsels in distress , man-eating plants and of course we have the creature , a huge mutant mix between a man and a hammerhead shark . Everything you need for an entertaining monster movie . The only thing missing are graphic sex scenes and nudity which you expect in movies of this kind , but since the movie was made for TV it 's understandable why these scenes are missing . And it doesn't matter anyway cause " Hammerhead " is action and horror entertainment at it 's best . There are two reasons why I gave it seven out of ten points , though : First of all , the monster isn't seen very often and the showdown with the destruction of the creature is too fast and poorly done , and secondly , William Forsythe just isn't the right guy for the " hero " part and for falling in love with gorgeous Hunter Tylo . Other than that , I can highly recommend this movie for any monster movie fan out there . Grab yourselves a cool drink and some popcorn , watch this movie and have fun . Jasper P . Morgan  
  i liked this movie a lot . I rented this expecting something not too bad to spend an evening . It turned out a particularly satisfying experience . Some scenes were hilarious and managed to be so in a movie not intended to be just a stupid slapstick comedy but with some meaning and moral values . It manages on both counts . The leads are all good but especially the guy who stars , also wrote and produced the movie . I 've never seen any of these actors before , but they were likable and made me care about what happens to them in the end which is saying a lot . The script is clever and involving and has a refreshing feel to it . I think you wont be disappointed to watch this .  
  How can you go wrong with the amazing Ramones ? What a crime that two of them are already dead . It reminds me of the Dennis Leary joke about great musicians dying in kitchen fires while useless ones live forever . I 'm paraphrasing here , but you get the idea . ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL tells the story of a group of disenfranchised kids fighting against their oppressive high school 's administration . It 's extremely silly stuff , but there 's an optimism about it that 's refreshing ( even if they do resort to blowing up the building ) . Who knew that this would actually become a concern for students around the world ? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a time capsule of an era when people still believed that music mattered and that it could make a difference to the larger society . It 's full of kids who know authority doesn't have the correct answers . Rather , rock and roll is the only thing they can trust . But most important , this is pure exploitation . Take none of it seriously . Just go in and have a good time . If this wasn't what high school life was like in the seventies , then it should have been .  
  I enjoy Ralph Bakshi films ( " Wizards " , " Cool World " and the underrated animated " Lord of the Rings " ) and am a Frank Frazetta collector and fan . I am also a sword and sorcery fan who loves the worlds of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E . Howard . I missed " Fire and Ice 's " theatrical release back in 1983 and have looked forward to seeing it on video or at some revival ever since then . Therefore the 2005 release was a dream come true for me . However , I bought it with some trepidation , because I hoped it would not be only worth watching once and then put on the shelf as a " collectible " gathering dust until the day I died . Fortunately my fears were groundless and I was pleasantly impressed with this movie . As with Frazetta art this is a gritty film that has a physicality and sexuality that is hard to find in most fantasy / sword and sorcery films without being cheesy or dirty . The art is good and you see glimpses of Frazetta at his best . Even my young boys loved watching it with me and ask to watch it again and again . However , my wife has some objections due to the scantily clad princess ( very Frazetta-esquire ) . I don't mind that because it is believable and there is no sex scene . There is roto-scoping used , but personally I enjoy roto-scoping . It gives more fluid and realistic movements to the characters that is hard to find in animation . Despite some continuity problems , I recommend this film to all Bakshi , Frazetta , Conan , and sword and sorcery fans . Enjoy !  
  I won't claim to be a fan of Ralph Bakshi , because i am not . I have only watched 5 of his animated films so far : Coonskin , Wizards , Fritz the Cat and Lord of the Rings and finally " Fire and Ice " . What i CAN claim , is that i found " Fire and Ice " to be the most enjoyable of the lot . It is a straightforward fantasy tale of swords and sorcery along the lines of Conan the Barbarian , but the beautiful artwork , realistic animation and lively film score effectively lends a very classic charm to this movie . Deserving first mention , is the animation itself . I do not care what people say about rotoscoping but in my opinion Ralph Bakshi used that technique very effectively here . I was amazed at how realistic the movements of the characters were . The style of directing and the photo-realistic character designs made " Fire and Ice " feel more like a big budget fantasy blockbuster than a cartoon . Sadly the level of art detail tends to get a little inconsistent , especially near the end of the movie . Some scenes just look really flat with little to no body contour details or fabric folds and shadows on the characters . With realistic moving characters , realistic action would naturally follow . Not only was the action well choreographed , but it was really brutal . I would be so bold as to compare the brutality of the action to live action movies like Zack Snyder 's 300 . I did notice however that though there was blood shed , the blood splatters were kept to a minimum . Again , a great choice by the creative team that only heightens the viewing experience by not taking things too " over the top " . Though i do not recognize any " big names " in the cast , the voice actors manage to deliver a satisfying performance ; keeping the delivery of every line realistically subdued and only hamming it up in the case of the bad guys . Did i say bad guys ? yes i did . Because that is exactly what the story is about , a standard good vs evil tale . Nothing really original about the story which seems to merely be a mix of pre-existing fantasy film clichés that involve scantly clad warriors and maidens . Anyone looking for " depth " would be sorely disappointed . THe characters are not given much development and some of them like Nekron and Darkwolf are one dimensional at best ( I did however hear rumor of some deleted scenes that explains Darkwolf 's obsession with killing Nekron and his mother . Scenes like that deserved full restoration and should have been included in the final cut to add a level of depth to the show ) . In fact , i would not be surprised to find out that the whole movie was just a " tech demo " of sorts to showcase the awesome animation and art , with the story cobbled together and thrown in as an afterthought in order to pass it off as a proper " movie " . A true classic of a bygone era , " Fire and Ice " really captures the blazing spirit of adventure and mysticism with its beautiful renderings of fantastic creatures and charming characters . It is a unique vision of a world created by Ralph Bakshi and artist Frank Frazetta with a good measure of action and suspense . Would it hold up to animated film standards of today ? Definitely not . But i urge animation fans in general to " get off your high horse " and give this simple but beautiful film a chance to grow on you . It is Truly a gem of the 80s worth checking out .  
  Almost the entire film takes place in a public bathhouse in China . There are no fancy sets , explosion or glamorous people-only fine writing , acting and direction ( Hollywood , take note ! ) . An estranged son returns home when he believes his father is dying . He is surprised to see that Dad looks fine and is going about running the family business as usual . In fact , he notices that his father and his retarded brother have really forged a close and caring relationship and it soon becomes obvious that he is out of the loop ! Dad is very traditional and this visiting son is from the big city and doesn't really see the value of the old bathhouse . How their relationship changes and where the plot goes from there is exceptional and believable . I was happy to see that not every Chinese movie is an action picture ( such as those starring Jet Li or Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon ) , as I don't particularly care for these frenetic films . The Shower as well as Springtime In A Small Town are two wonderful examples of good Chinese films about PEOPLE !  
  As a long-standing Barbra fan , any posting like this will be biased . That aside , this film ranks as a classic . It has it 's flaws ( emphasized in other postings ) , but gives a glimpse of a time ( late 70s ) that will never be there again , and is fascinating to watch unfold on screen . Streisand fought hard to make this movie her own . I don't think she was ever satisfied . But it gives her fans a new Barbra ( for the time ) with LIVE singing , a young fresh appearance , and some very heavy-duty acting . The story is rough , but exciting , and holds your interest throughout . The extended one frame " finale " is hard for most non-Barbra fans to sit through , but it speaks volumes to those who admire her talent .  
  The film maybe goes a little far , but if you love the show it 's what you expect . It 's not a bad movie ; it 's actually pretty good . If you don't like the show , don't see the movie . It starts off a little slow maybe , but then picks up and turns out to be pretty funny . There are even a few " heart-wrenching " scenes toward the end . After all the protagonists have gone through these scences do get to you . Also Jerry throws in his opinion why his show upsets people and justifies his show 's existience . He 's got a pretty good point . We care so much about the private details of celebrities lives , so why is it wrong that these people tell their private lives on national TV , too . If they were celebrities we wouldn't mind at all , we 'd eat it up . Do we not like his guest doing this just because they 're poor white trash and it reminds us that there really is poverty in this world and not just rich glamous movie stars living in a " Leave it to Beaver " world ?  
  As I reach the " backside " of 35 I find myself shaking my head more and more at the sex crazed , drug influenced teens of today . It was great to be reminded that it was just as crazy for me back in my day as it is for teens today . This film drives that point home to the core . If you are a late 70 's fan you 'll love the film . From KISS-posters to an Angel concert this movie rocks ! Watch for a young Laura Dern . Why they didn't have more songs from the Runaways I 'll never know ? I did have a problem with Randy Quaid 's character deflowering a 16 year old girl . While he was away she and her friends have a party that destroys dude 's house . The cops come and everything but no mention of all the underage drinking and how these kids got their hands on this stuff . Foxes belongs right there with Over the Edge , Fast Times , Dazed & Confused , and Kids as one of the all time teen angst flicks . I say buy it and watch it with your kids and talk about it all .  
  When I saw this movie a few days ago , my eyes were completely fixed to the screen . Its greatness held my attention to such an extent that I focused all of my attention on it for its entire duration . I would recommend seeing it not just to fans of anime , but to anyone who likes great movies period ( or who likes really weird stuff ) . The style of art is beautiful , the sound is perfect , and the symbolism within it is breathtaking . I 've heard complaints about the weird insertion of English text in the movie , but I think the way its done is complementary to the strange style of the movie . The self-attributed description of " Hello Kitty on acid " doesn't do justice to this film of absolutely epic proportions . I 'd like to find more works by whoever made this , and see them .  
  This movie is just so good ! Despite Carmen Electra , this has to be one of the better films I have seen in awhile . Jamie Kennedy is just amazing , and Loren Dean plays an insane spoiled movie star very well . The plot is great as well . It 's all very real which is scary . It says here that it 's a drama , but this is one of the damn funniest dramas I have ever seen . Go check it out .  
  OK I 'll be honest , when I first saw the trailer for the programme , I thought it was an advert for some sun-screen product . With all the people walking around on the beach . Despite this I decided to watch it , thinking it would be some new show I could laugh at . But I was seriously amazed . From the first 10 seconds of the program I was hooked , why is he lying in the trees , why did the plane crash etc etc . It 's not everyday that a show comes along which combines intelligence , humour , action and suspense . But ' Lost ' manages all of this . With a great cast and crew , beautiful locations , and pretty decent special effects , ' Lost ' will catch anyone who tunes in , and is a must see for anyone who 's sick of cheesy sitcoms and crappy reality TV . Lost is on Tuesdays at 10 on channel 4 ( UK ) 4 , 8 , 15 , 16 , 23 , 42 = O  
  Shot in the Heart is wonderful . It brilliantly illustrates the plight of Gary Gimore , a convicted murder who requested death . Shot in the Heart shows the ordeal that Gilmore 's family , torn up by hatred , went through . This movie is an incredible psychological study , and is wonderfully depressing and uplifting . 10/10  
  Having not seen this film in about 20 years I am still impressed with it ' s hard - hitting impact and stellar acting . Of course , one Mr . Mickey Rooney is indeed , INCREDIBLE in his role as the ring-leading " Killer " . ( In reference to another review here-none other than Orson Welles evoked Mickey Rooney 's name as the greatest movie actor , also . ) I also recall the jazzy-brassy score and the bare black and white photography . I love the Mick 's last line before he goes out for his dose of lead poisoning . ( I think the Stranglers lifted it for a line in one of their songs-Get a Grip on Yourself . ) This is a great film and unjustly buried film . Let 's get it out ! Side note-a recent Film Review magazine gave a big write up on Don Segal 's " Babyface Nelson " , made a couple years before " Last Mile " and also starring Mickey Rooney . Another rave of the Mick 's intense and sympathetic performance . Perhaps it 's the start of a groundswell of a appreciation for some truly superior cinematic performances .  
  Scanners II : The New Order is just as good as David Cronenberg 's classic Scanners , Scanners was made in 1980 and Scanners II in 1991 so their 's an eleven year gap between the two movies . The film captures the style of Scanners which is a good thing , it wouldn't be Scanners without a head explosion so Scanners II has a head explosion scene that 's just has gruesome as the first . Scanners II : The New Order has some other imaginative gory scenes that are done well . The plot to Scanners II : The New Order is a new take on the series since it has the Scanners being used as a vigilante force for a police chief and a group of scientists until a young Scanner named David Kellum discovers he 's being used and decides to get revenge . Scanners II : The New Order is a great sequel to David Cronenberg 's sci-fi classic Scanners and should be seen . Check this out . 10/10  
  Holly addresses the issue of child sexploitation that is rampant all over the world ( some 2 million children are trafficked every year ) and does so sensitively and without manipulation-a tall order that the team at Priority Films does with great success . American actor Ron Livington stars in the film alongside newcomer Thuy Nguyen , a Vietnamese actress who plays Holly , and together they bring to screen what is commonplace to the people at the notorious k11 redlight district in Cambodia . Although it tackles a heavy topic , the film holds on to moments of laughter and hope as we get to know the characters up close , keeping the two-hour film from being one that is too difficult to watch . I am glad a film like this is bringing the world 's attention to the problem . Child prostitution needs to be stopped and this is a very good first step . It 's GREAT and a film EVERYONE must see .  
  This was what black society was like before the crack epidemics , gangsta rap , and AIDS that beset the ghettos in the eighties . Decent , hardworking families that struggled to get by and all the traumas and tribulations they faced . Black America was a different group of people in the seventies . Still full of hope and flying high on the civil rights movements of the sixties , times were hard but still worth fighting for . Keepin ' your head above water , making a wave when you can , this show showed how black society struggled to work together as people and families , before they started to prey on each other and everyone else in order to survive the horrors of the ghettos . It is heart-breaking to see what the black ghettos were like then and what they have become now .  
  Shakespeare 's " The Tempest " is a model for this exceptional science fiction film . We look for differences . Prospero and his daughter , Miranda , are stranded on a Mediterranean island . " Morbius and Altaira are marooned on the 4th planet circling the star Altair . Ariel is a spirit . Robby the Robot is a man-made servant . Caliban 's evil hardly approaches that of Monsters of the Id . Shakespeare spares Prospero . Morbius dies when Altair 4 blows up . " The Tempest " is a comedy . " Forbidden Planet " is a tragedy . We wonder if mankind must suffer the fate of the Krell in some future time . Anne Francis is Altaira . Jack Kelly is Lieutentant Farman . Kelly starred with James Garner in the comedy / western TV series , " Maverick . "  
  I love Tudor Chirila and maybe that 's why i enjoyed the movie so much . Two days before the movie premiere I went to see his concert . I saw the trailer and the video " zmeu " before the movie and I thought I had it all figured .. i was wrong : instead of a good movie i assisted a great one ! i FELT the movie . it was sad .. it was funny .. but most of all it pictured LOVE .. I can't even begin to describe the soundtrack .. so i won't : ) I 'm not a movie critic .. I can't describe it in more words .. My kinda vague description is all because the play left me speechless .. thank god for the keyboard : ) Thank you Tudor Giurgiu , thank you Maria Popistasu , thank you Ioana Barbu and THANK YOU TUDOR CHIRILA . Encore ! : )  
  THE JIST : See something else . This film was highly rated by Gene Siskel , but after watching it I can't figure out why . The film is definitely original and different . It even has interesting dialogue at times , some cool moments , and a creepy " noir " feel . But it just isn't entertaining . It also doesn't make a whole lot of sense , in plot but especially in character motivations . I don't know anyone that behaves like these characters do . This is a difficult movie to take on - I suggest you don't accept the challenge .  
  Any Way the Wind Blows is Tom Barmans ( who is also know as front man of the rock formation ' dEUS ' ) debut movie . Entirely shot in Antwerp ( Belgium ) , the movie starts on a sunny friday morning and skips rather superficially between the events that fill the day of a dozen of main characters . When the movie ends , you have a lot of stuff to think about , because most of the different story-lines are left wide open . The movie has a ( purely instrumental ) sound track that will rock your socks off . In most scenes , the music truly enhances the general atmosphere and feel , really making the movie hallucinating to watch at certain points of time . The main scene in the film , the party , is very well shot . The director didn't hesitate to use video clip techniques , having his main characters dancing on one of the best sound tracks I 've heard lately . The screenplay is great stuff . Camera angles and colors are very well chosen . The ' costumes ' are very hot and very ' seventies ' too . And I loved ( most of the ) acting . The thing I liked most about the movie , are the subtle touches of absurd , surreal , very dry or even cynical humor that interleave . Without claiming to be a comedy ( this movie certainly is not a comedy but rather an alternative piece of art ) , it still manages to have its audience giggling and even burst into laughter at some times . This is one more directors ' debut that shouldn't be an ending . I hope to see more Tom Barman movies in the future because I had a good time . Cheers .  
  Does any one know what the 2 sports cars were ? I think Robert Stack 's might have been a Masseratti . Rock Hudson 's character told his father he was taking a job in Iraq , isn't that timely ? I have had Dorthy Malone in my spank bank most of my life , maybe this was the film that impressed me . Loren Bacall sure did have some chops in this film and probably out-acted Malone but Malones 's part made a more sensational impact so she got the Oscar for best supporting role . Was Loren 's part considered a leading role ? Old man Hadley character was was probably a pretty common picture of tycoons of his era in that he was a regular guy who made it big in an emerging industry but in building a whole town he had forgotten his children to have his wife bring them up . In time , being widowed he realized that they were all he really had and they were spoiled rotten , looking for attention , so rather than try to relate to his children he blew his head off . An ancient morality tale . But seriously , what were those sports cars ?  
  Very slow-paced , but intricately structured and ultimately very touching . A nice , very true-to-life look at a small Florida beach town in the dead of winter - I 've been there , and this is absolutely accurate . It 's also the debut feature of actress Ashley Judd , and she makes a big impression here . It 's hard to believe this film is 12 years old - I remember seeing it in theaters , and I recently rented " Ruby " again . Except for the 80 's looking clothes , it has held up very nicely . Ashely is so radiant and touching here , that it 's hard to think of her subsequent career without wincing . Boy , talk about failing to fulfill your early promise ! Anyone seeing Ashley here in " Ruby In Paradise " would assume this elegant , natural beauty went on to all kinds of interesting art films and serious acting - instead she has become the " go to " girl for dumb action films and slasher movies ! Very disappointing , but at least we have this lovely performance preserved to showcase her early promise . As some other commenter 's say , this is not for everyone as it 's very slow paced . This is not an action film , nor is it really a romance . The director ( Victor Nunez , " Ulees Gold " , another excellent character study ) treats this ordinary young woman 's life with deep respect , allowing her story to build slowly and with a lot of detail . In that way , I think this is one of the most moving and respectful coming-of-age stories about young women that I can recall - it 's not about Ruby 's sexual awakening or " how she lost her virginity " , but about her life choices and her growing maturity . A lovely film , if you take the time to watch it .. I think it would be a really excellent film to show teens and young girls ( or boys for that matter ) and give them a chance to think about and discuss it . Particular kudos to director Nunez , who also wrote the script , which is so realistic and nicely detailed that I assumed all through the movie that it was based on a female-written novel or memoir , but in fact it 's Mr . Nunez 's original work . Rated 8 out of 10 .  
  At first sight this movie doesn't look like a particular great one . After all a Bette Davis movies with only 166 votes on IMDb and a rating of 6,5 must be a rather bad one . But the movie turned out to be a delightful and original surprise . You would at first expect that this is a normal average typical ' 30 's movie with a formulaic love-story but the movie is surprisingly well constructed and has an unusual and original story , which also helps to make this movie a very pleasant one to watch . The story is carried by its two main characters played by Bette Davis and George Brent . Their helped by a cast of mostly amusing characters but the movie mainly involves just around them two . Their character are involved in a most unusual and clever written love-story that work humorous as well . It makes this movie a delightful little comedy to watch , that is perfectly entertaining . The movie is quite short ( just over an hour long ) , which means that the story doesn't waste any time on needless plot lines , development and characters . It makes the movie also rather fast paced , which helps to make this movie a perfectly watchable one by todays standards as well . It does perhaps makes the movie a bit of a simple one at times but this never goes at the expense of its entertainment or fun . A delightful pleasant simple romantic-comedy that deserves to be seen by more ! 8/10  
  I am a fan of animal movies . If you can take a plot and put animals as the main actors you will usually win me over . Homeward Bound did just this . They took a plot that has been as old as time and put a new spin to it . It was a complete success . It is very much an archetypal movie . You have the obi-wan of the group ( shadow ) who is wise and logical , you have the lovable but impetuous and untrusting Chance , and the prissy princess who thinks that she should be pampered and praised . These three personalities bounce off of each other very well . I also like how they made Chance and Sassy such dynamic characters , and they did not overdue it . Most people say that it cannot be good because it is too much of a kids film . What they are forgetting , however , is that it is supposed to be a kids film , and this still does not take away from the acual movie . This is a good movie to watch when you are bored and you just want to watch a movie . It is a Disney movie without the cartoons , an air bud movie with a better plot . I would , without a doubt , advise you to watch it .  
  I watched this film so many times through my child hood that even to this day i can pretty much re-sight all of the dialogue . And when I watch it now it just makes me happy and surprisingly still laugh . I think it 's amazing how they managed to train animals especially the cat to the extent that they are able to play the main role of a feature film . However watching it now I can also unfortunately notice that it isn't the masterpiece i once thought it was . But i prefer to remember how i felt about it when i was younger watching it on VHS on my fist TV that would cloud the image in yellow . And and bearing in mind it is a children 's film , that is why i would still definitely give it 10/10 .  
  Great voices , lots of adventure and clever dialogue make this a very good movie . The addition of " character " to the three lead animals gives the story a lot more depth and meaning , particularly the relationship between the older fellow , Shadow , and the young hellraiser , Chance . The earlier versions of this film were unable to give the animals any real personality or motive , which is done perfectly here . Sally Field is lovable in anything , but really shines in this film as the proud feline , Sassy . Great contrast between cat and dog perspectives on life , and just the right amount of spirit and warm fuzzies to make the plot and resolution excellent . There 's even an uplifting score and beautiful mountain scenery . Definitely perfect for an evening alone or with the kids . Hats off to Disney .  
  Just as Tom Berenger put you into the soul of Sgt . Barnes , he has done it again with Thomas Beckett . If I thought his world was folding in on him in the first scenes , it was nothing compared to how much more I felt during the last scenes . Great movie , even for a girl .  
  Maybe it 's because I looked up the history of the Irish troubles in the 1920s and then the sad Civil War that engulfed the Free State after the signing of the treaty before watching this movie . Anyway , the sudden turn at the end brought tears to my eyes . Victor McLaglen isn't as famous today as he was back then , and he should be better remembered . In this film , I think he 's playing himself as he would have been without his innate talent and brains . For example , the scenes where his buddy in the crowd is challenging men to fight with him is probably quite reminiscent of what McLaglen actually did in earlier years , when he was a world-class bare-knuckles boxer . John Ford is partly responsible for that ; the IMDb trivia section shows how he tricked McLaglen into getting a really bad hangover for the trial scene . This director also could bring out a lot in his actors , even without such tricks . Mostly , though , McLaglen is firmly in control , especially when his character is almost totally blotto ( which is difficult for an actor to do believably ) , and he also plays Gypo Nolan with a depth and emotional power that is surprising for someone who has only seen McLaglen later in his career , in " The Quiet Man . " I especially like the contrast between this role as an IRA man and the much more obviously controlled performance he gave as the IRA man Denis Hogan in " Hangman 's House . " In " The Quiet Man , " of course , McLaglen is a country squire at odds with the local IRA . Victor McLaglen was big and bully , in the old-fashioned sense of the word , but he was a good actor , too , and capable of wide range and fine nuances of performance that we just wouldn't expect of a such a man today . It 's a rather sad comment on our own set of expectations and prejudices . Ford , as usual , packs a lot into a little bit of film . All the characters are excellent ( though the Commandant 's mostly American accent is distracting ) - NOTE : There be spoilers ahead ! - Knowing that Gypo once drew the short straw and was ordered to kill a man but let him talk his way out of it instead , we really empathize with the man who draws the short straw for executing Gypo , and the humanity he shows , most notably when they go to take Gypo in Mary 's room . John Ford really shows his genius here , taking what could have been a gruesome and yet expected outcome to the whole story and instead using it to set up a totally unexpected and yet very satisfying ending that makes us think not just of Gypo and the other characters , but of poor Ireland during that tortured time .  
  Today if someone mentions the name Victor McLaglen the response most likely will be " Who ? " or perhaps " Why ? " Well , believe it or not , Victor McLaglen won the Academy Award for Best Actor in this film , which is about a poor , desperate man who is willing to sell out his best friend for " carfare " to the United States . It 's an interesting movie which shows how low even the most well-meaning shnooks will go just for a few bucks . The movie takes place in British-dominated Ireland and while all the other characters are either directly or indirectly fighting for the political independence of Ireland , all Mr . McLaglen 's character is concerned about is getting money and getting drunk . The movie makes one wonder whether political activism is worth all the trouble because while the activist is struggling to make a point , many others not only do not care , they don't even know what the fuss is all about . The morale of this movie is : look out for the friend , he may sell you out for a dime .  
  I remember watching this late at night on black and white TV , long before a live-action version was so much as a twinkle in Peter Jackson 's eye .. and being very impressed . Finally getting my hands this week on a VHS copy that was being thrown away ( and isn't that just par for the course .. ? ) I had the chance to revisit this film , and found that it still stands up quite well , although it 's not quite the success that memory had painted . I have to confess to a certain bias here . Some reviewers announce themselves as confirmed Jackson-lovers , others as Jackson-haters ; I 'm not exactly either . I was a devotee of the BBC Radio adaptation by Brian Sibley originally broadcast in 1981 , and instantly recognised the voice of Gollum here - Peter Woodthorpe would reprise this performance almost note-perfect for the radio three years later . I must say , however , that where I found Jackson 's films an increasingly indulgent disappointment , the Bakshi version , for all that it has been cut to the bone , is actually more accurate . Yes , there are the usual , understandable changes ( here it is Legolas rather than Arwen who is substituted for Glorfindel as the Elf sent from Rivendell to meet the party ) and there is a great deal of telescoping of the action . ( The only exception to the latter , as others have remarked , is the oddly extended sequence at the ford of Rivendell , where the Ringwraiths , having demonstrated a chilling ability to freeze and draw back Frodo in mid-flight - which they deploy again when he defies them after crossing the river - then for some unexplained reason simply chase after him in a prolonged straight gallop , which is initially nightmarish but pointless , plot-wise , and definitely goes on too long . ) I would also agree that the Balrog is unsatisfactory , due partly to bad animation , and that Gandalf windmills his arms too much . But having watched both approaches to the film , I feel more than ever that the animated route is the one to take . In a tale that is half-myth ( oddly enough , one thing that is included is a snippet of Aragorn 's story of Beren and Luthien ) the extreme literalism required by live-action filming , where everything from monsters to mail-shirts has to be created in detail to appear on camera , is counter-productive : latex-faced ( or CGI ) monsters are less monstrous than sketchily-drawn shapes , heroic costumes tend to look rather silly worn on real bodies , and hobbits or dwarfs with non-human body proportions are easy to animate but hard to film convincingly . Many reviewers have cited the sniffing Ringwraith in the woods , with its crippled , half-human movements , as one of the scariest moments in the film - it certainly frightened me silly when I saw it for the first time alone in the dark ! The extreme stylisation of the introduction ( plus a voice-over done with great skill and economy to sum up the back-story in a few sentences ) works very well to depict an almost mythical era , and the change to the comic-book rusticism of the Shire - I particularly like the Proudfeet - corresponds effectively to the similar change in tone of Tolkien 's prose . I did feel that there were some missed opportunities where the potential of animation could have been used to great effect : Gandalf threatening Bilbo with his true power in the opening scenes , Bilbo seeming to become a Gollum-like creature under the influence of Ring-lust at Rivendell , and Galadriel 's famous temptation speech all were drawn more or less straight , where it would have been trivial to distort the scene to reflect the hobbits ' changed perceptions . But generally speaking the changes in detail and palette - firelight hues at Bree , bright colours re-emerging at Rivendell and in the Fangorn clearing , dirty greys and browns for Moria and the desolate lands - work well to reflect the mood of the various episodes , where a live-action approach simply doesn't allow you to blur the background or sketch in a stylised setting . As a fan I didn't care for either Jackson 's or Bakshi 's depiction of Lothlorien - again , I feel that the radio soundscape was the best evocation I 've come across of a beautiful , slightly uncanny woodland paradise caught out of time - and I feel that Bakshi got the elven singing at this point pretty badly wrong , but I do like the little montage at this point showing the various members of the Company relaxing together after their travails in Moria . Aragorn giving a hobbit-fencing-lesson here is as charming ( and equally uncanonical ) a spectacle as Boromir engaging with the hobbits in Hollin in the Jackson version . The depiction of Aragorn as convincingly weatherworn Ranger is good throughout this film ( Viggo Mortensen 's scruffy Jesus look really didn't work for me ) , although it would have been interesting to see how they planned to ' clean up ' the character in the second half for Gondor 's benefit . John Hurt , unsurprisingly , gives a sterling vocal performance , as does a resonant William Squire in the part of Gandalf . The hobbits are , I suspect , intended to reflect contemporary youth as audience-identification figures : I find the animated style ( their proportions are much more ' cartoonish ' than those of the human characters ) works well to differentiate them , and the whole ' hairy feet ' thing as drawn here comes across as much more plausible than in more literal depictions , including much fan art . Personally I have less objection to Boromir as Viking - he was always a fairly bludgeoning type - than to beardy-Aragorn ( illogical : they were both Numenorians , after all ) , although I am clearly in a minority here ! The big flaw in this picture is always going to be the fact that it was an unfinished project , with a bizarre tacked-on voice-over ending attempting to resolve matters . A pity ; it would have been interesting , not to mention less frustrating , to see what Bakshi planned to make of Shelob and Minas Tirith , never mind the Dead ..  
  I saw it in a posh movie theater where the audience is usually white , educated , and urban . The showing I attended had a sprinkling of African-Americans , and it made the difference in audience-reaction between the two groups a wonderful social commentary on the state of race relations in this country . Basically , the white folks were AFRAID to laugh or laughed nervously at the funny bits - and there are many ! - because they 'd be " laughting at Blacks " , while the Blacks also stayed pretty silent because many couldn't laugh at themselves in front of the whites . I , on the other hand , being Asian ( and thus belonging to neither group ) , had a great time viewing this satire of rap culture and its egos / trappings / values / pseudo-philosophies . The cast is talented and does at great job becoming the characters portrayed . The songs are too funny to be believed . This film is one of the best pseudo-documentaries to come along , including " A Mighty Wind "  
  I 'm too old to know ( or care ) exactly what the difference between rap and hip-hop is . And , being Canadian , it 's likely that I 've never actually seen MTV , but I 'm not certain . But I thought this film was very funny when I saw it , a bright little satire . Hip-hop culture is so pervasive these days that it 's difficult not to keep hearing about it over and over . ( If only we could say the same about bagpipe music . ) I got most of the jokes ( at least I think I did ) . Sure , it 's derived from Spinal Tap , but there are lots of targets that could stand a Tap treatment . Just not the Carpenters , they 're sacred .  
  After what was considered to be the official Dirty Harry trilogy with The Enforcer ( 1976 ) to be the final chapter in the series . Dirty Harry is back , older , more dirtier and grittier than ever since the original 1971 classic . Dirty Harry in the past has killed a psychopath killer , vigilante cops , and Vietnam veteran terrorists . But now he 's after a new killer , a killer who wants payback , by gunning down her attackers . Sudden Impact brings a new meaning and more darker tone to Dirty Harry . Callahan is on a new murder case that is circling back to a woman ( played by Sondra Locke ) , who was brutally raped , along with her sister , who is left traumitized . Ten years after , she 's out for revenge by gunning down her attackers . At the same though Callahan is on a heat of trouble by his superiors after he provokes a mob boss to a heart attack , of which the mob are hunting him as well . So in order to let the heat die down within the city , Harry is on order to take a vacation on a seaside town , but at the same time the raped victim is in town as well , while hunting her attackers one by one . Harry is on the investigation and finds the killings very similar , as he homes in on the killer 's trails . Sudden Impact in my opinion , has to be one of my top 10 revenge films , as well as being the second best Dirty Harry movie yet , far better than both The Enforcer and The Dead Pool combined . Sudden Impact has what the original Dirty Harry had , a dark tone with entertaining value . So do you feel lucky , punk ?  
  With Harry Callahan getting up in years , the inevitable ` old man with a chip on his shoulder ' story had to come into play eventually . Callahan , looking fragile sometimes and out of place , his demeanor still was unwavering . Thankfully , this film took some time off to develop a different type of story , one that might reinvent the Dirty Harry and the whole genre . While the film fell short in doing so , it was still an excellent addition to the series , even if it was getting a little out of place during a time of silly fashion trends and New Wave music .  
  Sudden Impact is the 4th of the Dirty Harry films and one of the best traits of these films is that they don't really degrade in quality from one film to the next . Thus , Sudden Impact provides another thrill ride through the life of Dirty Harry Callahan . This time Harry attempts to solve a series of murders while on vacation . Harry 's always on the job it seems . Clint Eastwood plays Harry as he plays all his men of action , slow , deliberate , and without fear . As the first of the Dirty Harry films to be made in the 80 's , Sudden Impact lacks a bit of the 70 's feel that characterizes the first three films . This doesn't mean that it 's quality is any less . Bottom Line : Brimming with intensity and action , Sudden Impact is another worthy addition to the Dirty Harry series .  
  Brown of Harvard is a hard movie to pin down . We expect a lot more from our movies these days , so it helps to remember that audiences in the 20 's were a bit more innocent . William Haines is charming as the rogue who has to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and , even , glory . All of the relationships in the movie feel very stilted EXCEPT for the homoerotic tie between Billy and Jack Pickford , the town nerd . The movie has everything , romance , tears , love , death , and even sports .. It 's a great education in how society has changed in the 20th century .  
  An excellent movie . Superb acting by Mary Alice , Phillip M . Thomas , and a young Irene Cara . Tony King was very realistic in his role of Satin . This movie was one of the last predominately " all black " movies of the 70 's and unlike the " blaxploitation " movies of that era , this movie actually had a plot , and was very well done . The movie soundtrack , sung by Aretha Franklin , was popular on the R & B charts at the time .  
  As with that film we follow the implausible if always engaging adventures of the 2 lead characters . But whilst C + J eschew sex for a girly trip back into childhood , this pair revel in their carnality even to the point of exploring homoeroticism . Most of the sex they acquire from grudging or unwilling partners and yet , despite their deeply un-PC behaviour , everyone emerges smiling . Like C + G , through it all they remain innocents at heart , rebels against the quotidien , the bourgeois , the restrictive . As someone else has commented , I wouldn't want to know these 2 and it 's a minor miracle that their trip brings scenes of mostly comedy and very little tragedy ( and what there is of that cannot be laid at their door ) and thus for that reason , it left me beguiled but with a sweet taste in the mouth . Dare I say that only the French can get away with films like this . And that is part of their genius .  
  The movie has a distinct ( albeit brutish and rough ) humanity for all its borderline depravity - the zippy / lyrical score points up the comic side of their misadventures , and even when they 're at their most thuggish ( like terrorizing the woman on the train ) , a semi-pitiful vulnerability lurks never far away ( Dewaere sucks on her breasts like a baby ) . Blier cuts away from the scene where Depardieu may be about to rape Dewaere , so we 're never sure how explicitly to read the manifestly homoerotic aspect of their relationship - either way , that incident is the start of their relative humanization ( so the movie could certainly be read as pro-gay , although it could likely be read as pro-anything you want ) . The movie has many objectionable scenes and points of sexual politics and is probably best taken as a general cartoon on the foibles of both sexes , making a mockery of the whole notion of sensitivity and honesty , and hitting numerous points of possible profundity on the basis that if you fire off enough shots , some of them are bound to hit .  
  My first Fassbinder was a wonderful experience . Film and alternative cinema ( small hall , with uncomfortable seats ; public had to wait while filmrolls were changed ) were perfect match . There were many cliches used in the film , but Fassbinder presented them so cleverly that I found them really amusing . Sound was also brilliant ( sometimes back being louder than dialogue ) . Everything seemed to be in right place . And I loved the way how after-war-time was presented . Real fun !  
  I found this to be a profoundly amusing dark comedy . Brosnan is genius ; as anyone will now testify , he is not to be pigeonholed in the bond role . Kinnear was as charismatic and as funny as anyone could have been in the role . I don't know if I 've laughed as hard during any movie ! What an unexpected pleasure ! My favourite line would be ' I feel like a bangkok hooker on a Sunday after the navy left town ' . Brosnan delivered this very un-bond line with such unexpected comedic finesse . I was also very impressed with Hope Davis 's performance . It seems like everyone in this movie branched out from their previous work to such a degree that it actually improved the comedy . If you liked the dark and hilarious ' The Weather Man ' , you will definitely like this . I voted 10 .  
  Like TALK RADIO , THE BOOTH is actually kinda predictable ( TALK RADIO because we know the truth of what happened going in , THE BOOTH because of - let 's face it - the genre and the basic set-up ) . That 's not necessarily a bad thing , in this case . It means , in essence , that the filmmakers don't punk out in the end the way they might 've in , say , an American version of this story . THE BOOTH moves inexorably toward its ( foregone ) conclusion , but is so beautifully crafted on every level that one can enjoy the ride the way one might a familiar cruise along a well-travelled stretch of ( very scenic ) road . It reminds me of Harlan Ellison 's spooky short story , FLOP SWEAT . The claustrophobia is , at times , almost palpable . Worth a nice long look .  
  Thanks to Warner Archive , I can once again see this mammoth variety show which throws in everything but the kitchen sink . ( The bathtub , however is present . ) This film gives screen time to every person who was under contract to Warners at the time . If some of the artists seem unfamiliar to some , it is because they were big in the silent days , and most faded with the popularity of the talkies . There are some truly remarkable artists from the vaudeville era as well . You will be most impressed with Winnie Lightner , who performs two numbers . Also there is that French star , Irene Bordoni who croons a love song in a sexy manner . Perhaps one of the biggest highlights is the two-strip Technicolor " Chinese Fantasy , " which has been restored for this version . It is truly beautiful and it stars Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas . Finally , there is the massive " Lady Luck " finale which goes on for nearly a quarter of an hour . This is truly an epic of the early-talkie era . Any old-movie buff will love this .  
  Funny , sexy , hot ! There is no real plot but you needn't anyone .. so the naked or almost naked girls and the typical fights between college-cliques need no development ! All in all the whole seems to be known from simply every film in this category but the reissuer reached the goal that this film can be recognized out of thousand others . Last thing I 've got to say . Unbelievable funny ! You 've got to see it ! And if you are young and you want know more about the female body you 've got to see it twice  
  The plot : A crime lord is uniting 3 different mafias in an entreprise to buy an island , that would then serve as money-laundering facility for organized crime . To thwart that , the FBI tries to bust one of the mafia lords . The thing goes wrong , and by some unlikely plot twists and turns , we are presented with another " cop buddies who don't like each other " movie .. one being a female FBI agent , and the other a male ex-DEA agent . So far , so stupid . But the strength of this movie does not lie in its story - a poor joke , at best . It is funny . ( At least the synchronized German version is ) . The action is good , too , with a memorable scene involving a shot gun and a rocket launcher . But the focus is squarely on the humour . Not intelligent satire , not quite slapstick , but somewhere in between , you get a lot of funny jokes . However , this film is the opposite of political correctness . Legal drug abuse is featured prominently , without criticism , and even displaying it as cool . That 's the bit of the movie that seriously annoyed me , and renders it unsuitable for kids , in my opinion . All in all , for a nice evening watching come acceptable action with some funny jokes , this movie is perfect . Just remember : In this genre , it is common to leave your brain at the door when you enter the cinema / TV room . Then you 'll have a good time . 8/10  
  It 's so rare to find a film that provides a plot that can't be figured out at every turn . Surprises throughout delighting throughout . A couple of things I could not quite understand though is that here you have the lead female character who plays " the good girl , hard worker " and yet in the end she ends up being an anti-social risk taker . That was not enough to make me not like it though but it did give me pause . The other thing I could not get was the old man who was being hauled away by the police at the very end of the film . I never did get who he was or what his issues were . If anyone has any ideas , I 'd like to hear what they might be . The film was exciting and fun throughout and always left me guessing . Very much worth seeing .  
  I very much enjoyed watching this film . I taped it while watching so that i could review it later . I actually enjoyed the second viewing more since i was able to absorb more of the clever dialog between Natalie and Adam , the 2 main characters . I thought the way this story evolved was very thought provoking . I got very intrigued with how Natalie was going to interact with her daughter 's friends , at first it seemed that she was going to spew a lot of animosity but once she started interacting more pleasantly i had to see how this visit was going to unfold . i wasn't disappointed . Gradually the secrets that Sara kept from her mother started to reveal a daughter who was not so perfect , a flawed human being like most of us who wanted her freedom from a domineering mother who thought she knew her daughter but unfortunately had to learn in a very painful manner that sometimes to really love someone you have to give them their freedom . The viewers who stuck with this film to the end saw a very touching performance from Diane Keaton ( who is always wonderful , even in some of her less well received films-think Town and Country ) . The closing scene of Diane Keaton driving home was well worth waiting for , revealing that anyone who loves another human being has got to learn that we have to live our own lives , we love others but don't own them and ultimately we have to let go . It 's a hard lesson but well worth contemplating now and then . Thank you CBS for this broadcast , it was worth the long wait .  
  What can you say when you see a good French movie which tries to draw a suspenseful story in line with the social background of the characters ? The major point is we believe in those characters and once they 've met each other we want them to stay together . It 's simple and really efficient . The background story is less important . Why does the screenplay go on the side of a half-developed thriller ? It helps not to get stuck in those social demonstrations most French film-jerkers like to make . Not too much ambition , right : Sur mes lèvres is only an entertaining French film with good characterization . For all the clever noir points in the screenplay the end is by far too easy . It goes quite as easy as in Rear Window ( an obvious reference and definitely not a noir film ) but with a less compelling context . Where I am amazed it 's to see that the character of the probation officer has not been erased . He brings very little to the story ; when he appears alone we wonder if we 've not missed a part before . Jacques Audiard is not a new-comer yet . Strange and weird .  
  " Der Todesking " is not exactly the type of film that makes you merry Jörg Buttgereit 's second cult monument in a row , which is actually a lot better than the infamous " Nekromantik " , exists of seven short episodes  one for each day of the week  revolving on unrelated people 's suicides . In between these already very disturbing episodes , Buttgereit inserts truly horrifying images of a severely decomposing male corpse . The episodes aren't all equally powerful but , as a wholesome , " Der Todesking " is ranked quite high on the list of all-time most depressing art-house films . Particularly the episodes on Wednesday , involving a man explaining his sexual frustrations to a total stranger in the park , and the one of Sunday , focusing on a younger man molesting himself to dead , are extremely intense and devastating to observe . The added value of this film , or any other shockumenary like it , is debatable and I 'm not even sure whether or not Buttgereit had any type of message to communicate here . There 's the vague mentioning of an eerie chain letter that encourages its readers to commit suicide but mostly we remain uninformed about these people 's motivations to end their lives so dramatically . Entirely unlike I expected , " Der Todesking " isn't exploitative or repulsively graphic ! On the contrary actually , I never could have hoped Buttgereit would be so subtle and thoughtful regarding the portrayal of pure human misery . The Thursday episode is a perfect example of this , as it stylishly shows different viewpoints of a famous German bridge while the names , ages and occupations of persons who jumped off appear on the screen . The production values are inescapably poor and the editing often lacks professionalism , but this isn't what really counts in this type of cinema . The subject matter is strong and forcing us to contemplate about the less cheerful  but also indispensable  aspects of life . GREAT use of tragic music , too !  
  Nicolas Mallet is a failure . A teller in a bank , everyone walks all over him . Then his friend , a writer who 's books no one likes , has a plan to change his life . Our hero tells his boss he is quitting . He intends to spend the rest of his life making a great deal of money and sleeping with a great many women . And he manages to do just that . If it were not for the amount of death ( murder / suicide / natural causes ) in the film , this would be a farce . There are numerous jabs at marriage , politics , journalism and .. life . Jean-Louis Trintignant is a likable amoral rogue . Romy Schneider is at her most appealing . Definitely worth a look .  
  I had seen ' Kalifornia ' before ( must be about 10 years ago ) and I still remember to be very impressed by it . That 's why I wanted to see it again and all I can say is that it still hasn't lost its power , even though I 'm used to a lot more when it comes to movies than that I was ten years ago . ' Kalifornia ' tells the tale of the writer Brian Kessler and his girlfriend Carrie Laughlin , a photographer , who want to move to California . But instead of stepping on a plain and flying right to the state where they say it never rains , they choose to make a trip by car . He wants to write a book about America 's most famous serial killers and she will make the matching pictures . But because their car uses an enormous amount of petrol , they decide to take another couple with them , so they can spread the costs of the trip . Only one couple has answered the add , so they will automatically be the lucky ones . But they haven't met each other yet and when seeing the other couple for the first time , when their trip has already started , Carrie is shocked . Without wanting to be prejudiced , she can only conclude that Early Grayce and Adele Corners are poor white trailer park trash . She definitely doesn't want them in her car , but Brian doesn't really mind to take them with them and decides to stop and pick them up anyway . At first the couple doesn't seem to be that bad after all , but gradually Early Grayce changes from a trashy hillbilly into a remorseless murderer .. Not only is the story very impressive , so is the acting from our four leads . Brad Pitt is incredible as Early Grayce . His performance in this movie may well be his best ever . The same for Juliette Lewis . She plays the childish and naive girlfriend that doesn't want to hear a bad word about her Early and does that really very well . But David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes are a surprise as well . They both did a very good job and I really wonder why we never heard anything from Forbes again since this movie , because she really proves to have a lot of talent . Overall this is a very good and impressive psychological thriller with a very powerful story , but because of the graphic violence , I can imagine that it may not be to everybody 's taste ( although I don't really see another way how to portray a serial killer in a believable way ) . Personally I really liked this movie a lot and the violence never bothered me ( it 's a part of the story that 's too important to be left out ) . I reward this movie with an 8/10 .  
  WWE 's last PPV of 2006 , proved to be a hit with the fans , but for one reason only , the ladder match which was only scheduled to be Paul London and Brian Kendrick against William Regal and Dave Taylor . But with the recent crap PPV being December to Dismember , WWE knew that it had to do something to get the fans talking again , this proved useful when it introduced MNM and The Hardy Boyz to the mix and announced that the match was going to be a ladder match . The match was brutal and one of the best ladder matches I have ever seen , but Joey Mercury 's face was a total mess . Johnny Nitro didn't even check on his partner , they just carried on like nothing happened , and Taylor and Regal did nothing during the match except hit people with a few ladder shots . In the end London and Kendrick retained the titles . Elsewhere on the show Kane defeated MVP in a decent inferno match when he set MVP 's stupid costume on fire . Chris Benoit downed Chavo Guerrero in a decent match , Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to retain the WWE Cruiserweight Title in a solid effort . But the main event was a total mess , King Booker teamed with Finlay to take on John Cena and Batista . The action was shoddy and no one cared who Batista picked for his partner . Overall Results : Kane defeated MVP in an inferno match . Paul London and Brian Kendrick retained the WWE Tag team titles against The Hardy Boyz , MNM and David Taylor and William Regal in a ladder match . Chris Benoit defeated Chavo Guerrero to retain the US title in a decent match . Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to retain the Cruiserweight Championship . The Boogeyman beat The Miz in a terrible match . The Undertaker defeated Mr Kennedy in a last ride match . John Cena and Batista defeated King Booker and Finlay in an abysmal match . Overall Grade - B  
  A very high-standard Columbo story which was actually the first filmed episode of the long-running series but was originally transmitted second ( after " Murder By The Book " ) . Robert Culp makes his first of three appearances as the guest murderer in the series and plays the owner of a private detective agency , who blackmails the wife ( Patricia Crowley ) of a rich , highly influential businessman ( played very sympathetically by Ray Milland ) after he falsifies a report , in her favour , after it is discovered she was having an affair . The wife later rebels against the blackmail scheme but is killed in a fit of rage .. A very satisfying episode in many respects , particularly as the plot is so strongly set-up and subsequently developed and also because of the rare Columbo ingredient that the crime is an unpremeditated killing . The whole thing is further enhanced when the widowed husband uses the murderer to assist Columbo in his investigations : a feature that facilitates numerous good quality scenes , particularly in the first sequence when the three central characters meet and Columbo 's crucially deceptive qualities are wonderfully in evidence . Directed with flair by Bernard L . Kowalski and acted to an appropriately high level , this really set the tone for whole series ( since " Murder By the Book " was let down by a poor ending ) . The script by Columbo creators Richard Levinson and William Link is precise , well-structured and well-thought-out and is underpinned by a steady , productive pace and meaningful sequences which really exhibit the unpredictability of the story . Ultimately , the finale fittingly epitomises that Columbo has always been one step ahead of the murderer . Overall , this is a very fine piece of detective work for Columbo , and strongly suggests that the production team had worked positively and constructively to render a polished Columbo story .  
  This movie is full of references . Like " Mad Max II " , " The wild one " and many others . The ladybug´s face it´s a clear reference ( or tribute ) to Peter Lorre . This movie is a masterpiece . We´ll talk much more about in the future .  
  Lately I have been watching a lot of Tom Hanks films and old Chaplin films and even some of Rowan Atkinson 's early Bean performances , and it seems that all of them have their own unique charm that permeates throughout their work , something that allows them to identify with audience members of all ages , in a way that just makes you feel good . A Bug 's Life has that same charm , it has a connection with real life that allows us to easily suspend disbelief and accept a lot of talking insects , because even though they talk , they still ACT just like real bugs . It 's like the team that made the movie found a way to bring us into the mind of a child and allow us to think like them , to imagine bugs the way a young mind does . Honey , I Shrunk The Kids was one of my favorite films when I was younger , and to me , A Bug 's Life is like a more realistic version of that movie , if only because the animation is so breathtaking and this style of story-telling just opens up so many more narrative possibilities . I try not to compare it to something like Toy Story ( which I still maintain is the best computer animated film ever made ) , because the story of A Bug 's Life is not quite as good as Toy Story 's , but then again , almost nothing is . The important thing is that it is still wonderful fun . The story concerns a colony of hard working bugs who have an impressively developed society , mostly geared around building a harvest of food , most of which will go to the tyrannical grasshoppers , vastly superior in strength and general meanness , and hopefully still leave enough left over for the bugs to make it through the winter . We are treated to some visits from the grasshoppers , who make it clear that if the bugs provide an unsatisfactory quantity of food , the consequences will be dire . And incidentally , the similarities between this crippling level of food extraction is strikingly similar to Mao Tse-tung 's vicious forcing of food from his own people during the " Great Leap Forward " The fun and excitement begins when Flik , the main character , sets off on a quest to find a gang of appropriate warrior bugs to come back and help defend the colony against the grasshoppers . You see , he spilled all of the amassed food and placed everyone in great danger , so he feels it 's his responsibility , but he inadvertently ends up hiring a struggling group of insect circus performers . Great for the audience , not so great for the safety of the clan . The movie was released back in the late 90s , when so many films seemed to have been coming out in twos , like Armageddon and Deep Impact , Independence Day and The Arrival , A Bug 's Life and Antz , etc . Comparisons between A Bug 's Life and Antz are inevitable , although it seems clear to me that A Bug 's Life is by far the superior film , and not only because it doesn't star Woody Allen stuttering and whining through the lead role . This is great family fun !  
  This movie just pulls you so deeply into the two main characters . I popped it into my laptop without even reading the cover ( let alone reviews ) and was intrigued for two solid hours . Two lost ships from two different worlds collide . The sexual tension that brews between a secretary and a criminal is almost palpable even without hardly any physical contact . Toward the end I couldn't decide which I wanted more : Our hero and heroine to pull off their caper or simply consummate their passion . RML could 've done without a curious subplot and a traditional 100 minutes would have been plenty . I 'm nitpicking though . After a series of Netflix , Blockbuster and local library duds this movie restored my faith in great film making .  
  I watched this movie 11 years ago in company with my best female friend . I got my judgment teeth pulled out so I didn't feel very good . I ended up liking it big time . It 's a hard watch if you take in account that it deals with friendship , unwanted betrayal , power , money , drug traffic , and the extreme hard situation that deals with living in a foreign jail . The acting is on it 's prime level . Two of the women that I lust the most star and that 's a good thing . Claire Danes is as cute and charming as always while Kate Beckinsale is extremely hot and delivers a fine performance . Bill Pullman is also great and demonstrates his histrionic qualities . There are many plot twists to dig from and make it an interesting visual experience . Plus it shows the difficult times at Thailand . This is an underrated movie . Not many films like this one have come up in recent history . It should make you reflex about many things ..  
  I caught this movie by accident on cable in the middle of it and had to rent it to see it 's entirety and I 'm glad I did . I was immediately drawn by the storyline and cared about the girls involved . Naive high school graduates , best friends since childhood , take a high school trip and are taken in by a con man named Nick who get them into serious trouble . They are used as sacrificial mules in a heroin smuggling ring . Taken in to custody the girls learn to cope with their incarceration while trying to find a way out of their trouble . Everything that they try to help themselves falls short when the Thai criminal justice system shows shortcomings and the girls end up in more trouble and lose the trust of their American lawyer " Yankee Hank " . Hank gives up trying to defend them after he feels betrayed by Alice ( Claire Dane ) . However , the Thai native wife of Hank smells a rat in the case and does some further foot work of investigation and finds out the girls really were victimized . The end of the movie when Alice does a selfless act to save Darlene ( Beckinsale ) had me in tears . I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it .

  Gentleman Jim not really a boxing film . It is a vehicle for Errol Flynn as Jim Corbett . But having said that , the boxing scenes are a real eye-opener to the modern viewer . There are no 12 round , points decisions here . Errol Flynn plays the Irish bank clerk who gets a shot at the heavyweight world title . Flynn is well suited to the role of suave but unpredictable Corbett . His opponent John Sullivan is still better however , a bruiser of the old school played by Ward Bond . The theme of the film is a man pushing for his big chance . Corbett leaves his mundane life behind and builds a new persona as Gentleman Jim . Jim is a chancer who can adapt to any social environment . He is a liar and an egotist . Sullivan the heavyweight boxing champion is portrayed as a simple brute but his honesty and sportsmanship gives a certain contrast to the main character . There is action and excitement aplenty and a wonderful ending with the requisite redemption for all . And Errol Flynn gets the girl .  
  Chang Cheh 's " Shaolin Temple " might very well be the highwater mark of the Shaw Brothers martial arts film cycle . This rousing kung fu epic boasts an amazing cast - a veritable who 's who of the Shaw stable . Though the plot is fairly standard and the fight choreography is superb as usual , it is Cheh 's handling of the subject matter that makes this film remarkable and enjoyable . The sense of reverence displayed for the history and traditions of the Shaolin Temple is palpable in every frame . Not unlike William Keighley 's paean to the fabled Fighting 69th in that same self titled film or John Ford 's salute to West Point in " The Long Gray Line , " Cheh 's " Shaolin Temple " is a lovingly crafted ode in that same style . The cultural correlation I am tempted to make , is to compare the Shaolin Temple to the Alamo . Watching this film will give the same admiring and nostalgic feelings that you experienced many years ago in grade school history when you learned of the courage and sacrifice of those doomed heroes of the Alamo . At the end of the film , you too might be tempted to call out , Remember the Shaolin Temple !  
  the movie is great , like every other international project that includes strong impressions . three of them ( israel , bosnia and egypt ) should 've been cut out . especially bosnian clip , which is pathetic beyond all reason , and doesn't contain a single original thought or element on it 's own . everything else is really great , unrecognizable for most of americans , known for the rest of the world . unfortunately , clips speak about misery of the people all over the world . and , as i see it , there are so many of those who won't give a damn about it .. top 5 : 1 . loach 2 . penn 3 . inarritu 4 . lalouche 5 . imamura  
  As you may know , the subject here was to ask eleven directors from all over the world to make each a short movie of 11 minutes , 9 seconds and one frame . We have here : - Samira Makhmalbaf ( Iran ) : what afghan refugee kids can understand to the towers collapsing ? Well , nothing . A great lesson . - Claude Lelouch ( France ) : a weak plot with a great cinematography .. Just imagine a deaf woman living by the WTC who sees without understanding it that her dog barks .. Well just see it . - Youssef Chahine ( Egypt ) : the greatest oriental movie maker has compassion .. For everyone : for an us soldier who died ten years ago , for the people in the Wtc but also for a palestinian suicide-terrorist . Maybe the less tender movie towards the us . - Danis Tanovic ( bosnia hrzgovia ) : good images , makes us travel , for sure .. Not a very good plot . Idrissa Oudraogo ( Burkina Faso ) : from one of the poorest country in the world , a tender and funny story about five boys who want to capture Osama Bin Laden .. And they could have done it but nobody believes them when they tell they know where he is . Ken Loach ( uk ) : September 11 , 1973 , The Chile entered in a twenty-years long bloody dictature . Thousands of death , tortures : all that was offered to Chile by Henry Kissinger and the CIA , and knowing this changes very much your point of view ! I guess that is because of that particular short that no american movie distribution company accepted to release the movie in us theaters ! Loach forgot to point that 1973 is also the year when the WTC was built ! - Alejandro Gonzalez inarritu ( Mexico ) : impressing images that we all know too well , and a lot of black screens . I didn't get this one very much , it is more an artist video ( to show in an exhibition ) than a movie . - Amos Gitaï ( Israël ) : an absurd ballet of policemen , journalists , etc . , around a burning car in Jerusalem . Very well done . - Mira Nair ( India ) : about the anti-islamic feeling that followed september the 11th . Very good actualy . - Sean Penn ( us ) : a funny little story that reminds us a fact usualy forgotten , the WTC did have a huge shadow , and some places now have a daylight they never had . - Shohei Imamura ( Japan ) : a different one . Here there is not even one word about the WTC , and the action takes place at the end of WWII . It has only one message : no war is holy . This short movie gives very deep feelings , but the director aparently would have done better with more than 11 minutes . - so - A great movie , a great attempt to take the world 's temperature . I love it .  
  Good film . Tells a boyish fantasy story , telling us how trapped we are in social situations and what kind of extreme measures one has to take to behave differently . Or at least the feeling : that you have to break every rule if you are to break one . If you wanted to express love for someone you don't know , how would you do it without creating a pressing social situation ? Also it 's about the fascism of deciding over others cultural life , of what kind of culture that is jammed down our throats . What gives Disney or FOX or the suicide bomber the right to decide what is our choice . Are one not allowed to drink the morning coffee by one self . Do we have to listen to the NRJ shouting , see the stupid tabloid headlines and the street commercials before we even have had our morning coffee ?  
  I had first watched this several years ago on a now-defunct Sicilian TV channel ; amazingly , the film emerged as a heftily-priced DVD from Criterion : not being sure what I had made of it initially ( despite having attained cult status over the years , the achievement proper is clearly viewed with modesty even by genre buffs ) , I opted not to make the purchase  as I did with the similar and , to me , unfamiliar FIEND WITHOUT A FACE ( 1958 ) . Recently , however , I managed to acquire THE BLOB via a copy of the Spanish DVD which , interestingly , ported over the two Audio Commentary tracks from the Criterion " Special Edition " but , regrettably , I could not switch off the Spanish subtitles during playback of the main feature ! Anyway , looking at the film anew , I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it ( despite many a narrative flaw , which I will get to later )  as a pure example of ' B-movie ' schlockiness ( atypically shot in pleasant color ) and a time-capsule illustrating late 1950s social attitudes . The male lead was an early role for Steve ( n ) McQueen and , though the actor may have subsequently looked at it with disdain , his sole contribution to the genre proves fairly engaging : not averse to juvenile kicks but still essentially a decent ( and , more importantly , altruistic ) kid . The special effects depicting the slimy and expanding creature are not too bad of its kind and period ; the film itself rises to a good climax  beginning with the monster 's invasion of a cinema ( showing DAUGHTER OF HORROR [ 1953/7 ] as I mentioned recently in that film 's review but being curiously screened ' flipped ' and which sequence , incidentally , would be featured at the opening of a satirical Italian program actually called " Blob " ! ) . As to the admittedly minor quibbles I have with the film : the monster is not shown traveling  it just turns up at a variety of places , never being seen by anyone ! ; there is a baffling over-emphasis ( tantamount to padding ) on the kids ' scrapes with Police ; it is silly to have the town doctor shoot at The Blob  as if fluid , whatever its proportion , can be destroyed by bullets ! ; equally nonsensical is having the teenagers alert the townsfolk of the danger by making door-to-door visits ( especially when considering that , at that stage , only McQueen had actually seen the monster in action ) ! An inferior sequel emerged in 1972 called BEWARE THE BLOB ! ; the original was then remade in 1988  I watched this not too long ago but it seems not to have made a lasting impression on me ( though I know Micheal Elliott loves it ) . For the record , I will be following this viewing with two more collaborations between director Yeaworth and producer Jack H . Harris , namely 4D MAN ( 1959 ) and DINOSAURUS ! ( 1960 ) .  
  What can I add that the previous comments haven't already said . This is a great film and the Light Sabre duel Star Wars tribute has to be seen to be believed ! There are moments of genius throughout this movie , if you can , SEE IT NOW ! Thanks again to Rick Baker who gave me this movie many years ago !  
  Two things haunt you throughout L'intrus ( The Intruder ) : who 's the intruder and is it a movie or a dream you 're watching ? The ending is so shocking that for a while you 're at a loss for an answer to either of those questions . The intruder pops up as different characters , different men in different circumstances who don't belong in the scene , so they 're expelled from it , kindly or brutally , but often without emotional involvement . The main character , Louis , is a contemptible man . He 's got rough ways , some mean job and no heart . He needs one and goes after it . He has a heart transplanted and afterwards decides to start a new life . Can this man succeed in his quest for redemption ? A guy like that could cut your throat at the drop of a hat . You know it but Claire Denis doesn't encourage you to judge him . Occasionally , there 's a young Russian woman -a beautiful girl who seems to inhabit someplace between heaven and earth - who does judge him . She may even punish him . But not Denis . There 's the character played by Beatrice Dalle who wants no business with him : don't touch me , she says . But Denis lets this man be himself , films him in his self-absorbed quest . I don't know if what she films is the heart or the mind but it isn't the traditional plot basics . Whatever she films , you get it in the end . You know who 's " the " intruder , you know why , more or less , and some scenes come back to your mind with their full meaning . But was it a movie or a dream ?  
  Sammo Hung 's 1989 film Pedicab Driver is considered by many to be his masterpiece . I have to agree to some extent as the film in its greatest parts really gets as incredible and fantastic as any Hong Kong film ever has . It is a combination of pretty good and well written drama , interesting and sympathetic ( and also non-sympathetic ) characters , some genuinely funny humor and truly over-the-top hyper kung fu that is guaranteed to make many jaws drop when someone not familiar with Hong Kong cinema watches the film as well as it does to the experienced enthusiasts of the unique industry . Sammo and Max Mok Siu Chung play two pedicab drivers who live in Hong Kong in the middle part of the last century , I think . They drive their cabs and are also desperate for love . Sammo is interested in local baker girl Ping ( Nina Li Chi ) while Max one day meets a mysterious and beautiful Fennie Yuen Kit-Ying he falls madly in love with . Many other characters get introduced , too , and they remain pretty clear all the time if the viewer really concentrates on the film and its plot so I cannot say the film is confusing as it could be much worse especially in Hong Kong ! Soon we get to know , for instance , that a ruthless gangster family is terrorizing the neighborhood and of course their violent acts affect our protagonists , too , and so the premise for some of the most incredibly choreographed kung fu fight sequences has been created . As well as some nice drama . The film has a great cast . The leads are all very good and restrained ( not as painfully awful over-acting and " humor " as in Sammo 's otherwise great Eastern Condors ( 1987 ) , for example ) and they are also , thanks to the carefully written screenplay , pretty likable and easy to identify with . The cast includes many familiar HK cinema faces and directors in small roles like Corey Yuen Kwai ( the legendary action director and director of films like Saviour of the Soul 1 and 2 , Ninja in the Dragon 's Den and Fong Sai Yuk 1 and 2 ) , the masterful composer Lowell Lo Koon-Ting ( John Woo 's The Killer and Ringo Lam 's School on Fire and Prison on Fire among many others , Pedicab Driver included ! ) , the Shaw veteran Liu Chia Liang ( whom with Sammo has a furious fight with sticks ) , Alfred Cheung Kin-Ting ( the director of dark HK noir classic On the Run from 1988 ) , the late great Lam Ching Ying ( best known for his friendly face in various HK vampire horror / kung fu / comedies ) to name just a few . In fact , the cast in Pedicab Driver is one of the most interesting I 've seen in any other HK production . The film has some interesting peaceful moments most notably about the love affair between Max Mok and Fennie Yuen and one crisis they confront thanks to Lowell Lo 's character . They really could have done this a completely serious piece if they had wanted as the discussions about human values and meaning of love , no matter what 's your past or what you 've done for living , get so serious and genuinely effective at the middle part that the film immediately gets much more noteworthy than our average kung fu spectacle actioner . Also the other characters ' efforts to cure things is very touching and tells delightfully much about right human relations and friendship , and of course love . Still I think what Fennie says to Max ( about the future " bad cooking " ) is very unnecessary and tones the potential of the whole segment and its themes down pretty effectively , unfortunately . But then we get to the thing the film makers were interested the most in . Which is the action , the outrageous and over-the-top action . The fight scenes include traditional kung fu , some sticks , meat cleavers and the like and they 're used here as hysterically as in the most mind blowing kung fu scene I 've seen in any film ever , Jackie Chan 's Drunken Master II ( 1994 ) , they really are that great ! There are wires and they 're used very cleverly and people literally fly to the opposite corner of the room when they get kicked or punched . Simply amazing and again something ONLY Hong Kong cinema can deliver . Also the dangerous stunts make the viewer hold his / her breath as the film has one fast car vs . pedicab chase sequence and various dangerous looking jumps and twisting bodies flying through the air and crushing with force to the hard destination . Still the film makers seem not to " accept " the violence of the film as Sammo is , like the late Bruce Lee , willing to give himself up after the final murderous mayhem at the gangster villa , and I think this kind of morale , no matter how obvious or shallow it may be , is a good thing even in a harmless film like this , as cinema is meant to be much more than just brainless entertainment . The film has also some very witty bits of humor that I 'm not sure everyone in Hollywood or America ( for example ) would understand or like at all . The hilarious Star Wars gag at the beginning is definitely among these and it literally forced me to laugh when I realized what I was seeing . Also some funny scenes are created out of Sammo 's passion for Ping . Still , the greatest amazement-filled laugh came during the scenes depicted in the former pharagraph as the imagery of big and tall men flying with great force over the screen to the walls or furniture is simply INSANE and so breathtaking I just cannot hide my feelings and thoughts about these Eastern film makers when I witness something like this , and this is nothing but positive and appreciating reaction , of course . Pedicab Driver is among the most incredible Hong Kong action films that I have ever seen and easily among Sammo 's greatest achievements . If the few minor flaws were not there , this could rate even brighter and higher . 8/10  
  Rock n ' roll is a messy business and DiG ! demonstrates this masterfully . A project of serious ambition , and perhaps foolhardiness , the filmmaker is able to mend together seven tumultuous years of following around two unwieldy rock groups . With that said , the abundance of quality material ensures the film 's ability to captivate the audience . If you 've ever been interested in any realm of the music industry , this movie will undoubtedly be an arresting viewing . the music in the film , although it suffers minimally from requisite cutting and pasting , is worth the price of admission alone . the morning after i saw DiG ! i went straight to the record store to pick up a Brian Jonestown Massacre album ( i was already initiated to the Dandy Warhols ' sounds ) . Primarily defined by its exploration of rock music , the film succeeds at other profound levels . DiG ! is a sincere , and sufficiently objective , glance into the destructive and volatile nature of the creative process and the people that try to wrangle those forces .  
  Imagine the plight of Richard , a painter , whose real passion is flying . When we first meet him , he is seen atop a building in London wearing his home made wings . He has ripped his canvases and other works , at the height of his despair , and fashions a flying device for his jump . When he falls into the protective police contraption , he doesn't suffer a scratch , but it lands him in front of a judge who orders him to do community service . Richard , whose relationship with Anne apparently ended badly , decides to relocate to a rural area where he finds a place in the country with a large barn he plans to use to construct his own plane . Richard ends up trying to help Jane Harchard reluctantly . She is a young woman suffering from A.L.S. , or Lou Gehrig 's disease and is confined to a motorized wheel chair . Jane is extremely intelligent , but has a dark side and a salty vocabulary . She uses a hand held device to speak sometimes , as her speech is not clear . What Jane loves to do is to lose her virginity , at any cost . Jane and Richard clash as they meet , but a mutual tolerance soon makes them comfortable with one another . Jane , who watches porn on her computer , has a notion for finding someone like Richard Gere in " American Gigolo " , who will , for a fee , have sex with her . When Richard takes her to London , they find the right man for the job . His fee is exorbitant , but they agree . Since they have no money , Richard decides to rob a big bank . Unfortunately , things don't go according to plan when Jane realizes that she can't go through with what she had wanted . At the end , Richard takes Jane for a ride in his crudely built plane for the thrill of her life , something that brings them closer , as they find an affinity with one another . Peter Greengrass directed this quirky film which presents an unusual situation . Jane is clearly not the romantic heroine in mainstream films , and yet , she has such a sweet aura about her that is hard not to feel for her and what she is trying to accomplish . Mr . Greengrass shows an affinity Richar Hawkins ' material he wrote for the film . The movie doesn't try to be cute or give a rosy picture of a young woman afflicted with an incurable disease . Helena Bonham Carter is the main reason for watching the film . She makes a wonderful Jane . On the other hand , Kenneth Branagh doesn't seem too well suited for this type of comedy . Somehow , he has problems of his own in the way he interprets Richard . Gemma Jones has some good moments as Anne , Richard 's former love . " The Theory of Flight " shows a good director . No doubt Peter Greengrass will go to bigger and better things .  
  I loved October Sky . The thing I loved most had to be the music . It worked two ways : in the first hour of the film , it gives the viewer a time-frame . This is done by playing songs from the late Fifties . In the second hour , an instrumental score takes over . The music now fits the mood of the film perfectly . I did not only enjoy the music , I also quite enjoyed the cast . Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially a surprise for me . He gave off a first-class performance , as did Chris Owen ( Quentin ) and Chris Cooper ( John Hickam ) . I 've seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now , and both times I thoroughly enjoyed myself .  
  Based on fact , this is the story of a teenager named Homer Hickam ( Jake Gyllenhaal ) , growing up in a coal town in West Virginia where a boy 's usual destiny was to " end up in the mines . " But Homer had his eye on the sky and a love for flying rockets , to the dismay of his mine-foreman father , and the consternation of the townsfolk generally . A misfit for sure , he and three of his equally outcast buddies begin making rockets , which they fly from a patch of barren land eight miles out of town , so as to no longer terrorize the community with their oft-times errant rockets . Unfortunately , most of the town and especially Homer 's father ( Chris Cooper ) thinks that they are wasting their time . However , the people become intrigued and soon start coming out in droves to watch the ' Rocketboys ' send off their homemade missiles . Only one teacher ( Laura Dern ) in the high school understands their efforts and lets them know that they could become contenders in the national science fair with college scholarships being the prize . Now the gang must learn to perfect their craft and overcome the many problems facing them as they shoot for the stars . Director Joe Johnston has always been a famous name for his movies such as Jumanji & Jurassic Park 3 & " October Sky " surely stands above all of his other films . Without any doubts , " October Sky " is his best effort & obviously his best film . It 's not only a true story filmed extremely well , but even as a movie , it has every single thing , which is required for a top level cinema . And along with Johnston 's extra-ordinary direction , are some exceptional performances . Jake Gyllenhaal was around 19 , when this movie was released & he gives a beautiful & natural performance . He is a perfect actor . Chris Cooper as his father , also gives a very fine performance . The same goes for Laura Dern & also she looks beautiful . Even the rest of the performances are extremely well . The background score was fine . Highly inspiring movie , which lifts up your spirit sky high . One of those movies which definitely inspires you for all of your life . An amazing inspiring movie along with loads of entertainment . Not to be missed .  
  I just accidentally stumbled over this film on TV one day . It was aired in the middle of the day on a channel not exactly famous for airing good movies . This one , however , was nothing less then good . October Sky tells the true story of Homer Hickam , a boy inspired by the Sputnick launch to become a rocket scientist . He and his friends begin to build rockets . His father is not to happy about his sons new found hobby and would rather see him become a coal-miner as himself or go to college on a football-scholarship like his brother . The story is well written . A bit too predictable maybe , but that 's OK cause it doesn't focus too much on those parts of the story . It 's important part , but where this is obvious the inner action , the action between the characters is focused on . The story is good . It has some clichés , but that 's OK . It 's based on actual event 's so you kind of can't just drop out these clichés . The characters are really good . Where the story is on a downhill the characters are brought out and manage to keep the action and the quality of the movie high . You get to know these characters and you get sympathy for them . They are well written and believable . This is a good looking movie . The sets and the 50 's style is thorough and the pictures are well composed and well lit . This all sets the mood of the film very good . The acting is really good . Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a great performance as Homer Hickam and Chris Cooper is good as John Hickam . As for the rest of the cast they are good too . All together this makes out a pretty strong cast . All in all I 'm glad I caught this movie . It was first after seeing it I learned that it was based on actual events . If I had known that when seeing it , it would probably just be even more interesting . October Sky is a good and interesting movie . It 's a movie I believe everyone can enjoy . It 's kind of a feel-good movie . Not bad at all !  
  Suraj Barjatya is best in movies on marriage . And here he is ; back to his basics on Vivaah . As the story goes this is a story from engagement to marriage . A movie you can watch with your entire family around you . A movie you will hate watching alone . The story is simple , but the music is good , cinematography is excellent , direction is best , everything about the movie has a class of its own . There are a lot of scenes which will make you cry and am sure if you are watching the movie with your sweetheart , you both are definitely going to hold each others hand till the end of the movie . Shahid & Amrita jodi has given us hit movies earlier like Ishq Vishq , & Shikhar . Though Shikhar was a good movie it wasn't accepted well by the public . A truly Shahid & Amrita film .  
  I have never seen such a movie before . I was on the edge of my seat and constantly laughing throughout the entire movie . I never thought such horrible acting existed it was all just too funny . The story behind the movie is decent but the movies scenes fail to portray them . I have never seen such a stupid movie in my life which is why it I think its worth watching . I give this movie 10 out of 10 for being the most pathetic movie ever created , this movie seems like it was solely created to become trash . I mean the scenes seem so fake and the actors act like " the camera is in front of them " . You will get a kick just watching how lame this movie is , me and my friend could not stop making jokes during the movie , the darthvader guy who tries to get the girl got ran over not once but twice and the second time he got ran over it sounded like he said sh ! # although he doesn't speak English lol . If you watch this movie you will think to yourself that all those other movies you didn't like you took for granted they are way better than this . This movie should be seen out of curiosity as well as what kind of movie DEFINES lame . The evil serpent encountered the girl so many times it was ridiculous , the evil serpent just roared and roared and let her get away every time . The evil serpent had so many chances it was like god was trying to say hurry up and eat the girl how many miracles do you want . The transition between scenes leaves you wondering did I miss something ? So many plot holes from scene to scene . I was laughing like crazy when they decided to " Escape To Mexico " to get away from the serpent . Hmm hopping the border will save you from a serpent from Korea ? interesting .. very interesting .. I guess hopping the border solves all problems . Another scene that completely stupified me .. they met for the first time and had a romantic scene at the beach they kissed and didn't even know each other .. the scene was so clichéd and the was no substance at least in other movies it might seem logical afterwhile but i mean they JUST MET even though they are reincarnations there feelings were like they instantly loved each other instead of it rather developing . Anyways this movie is worth watching for the sake of opening your eyes and seeing the light . Bad Hollywood movies will seem like heaven when compared to this . In the end its worth watching you wont get bored you will be occupied criticizing every moment , every scene in your head .  
  Domestic Import was a great movie . I laughed the whole time . It was funny on so many levels from the crazy outfits to the hilarious situations . The acting was great . Alla Korot , Larry Dorf , Howard Hesseman , and all the others did an awesome job . Because it is an independent film written by a first-time writer , it doesn't have the clichés that are expected of other comedies , which was such a relief . It was a unique and interesting and you fall in love with the characters and the heart-warming story . I heard it was based on a true story ? If so , then that is hilarious ( and amazing ! ) . I highly recommend this movie .  
  The movie begins a with mentally-challenged girl with bright yellow sneakers looking skyward on a Madrid street corner and being spellbound by a passing plane . The movie examines the life of five womenAdela , Leire , Maricarmen , Anita & Isabelwho have completely different lives and choices of shoes . Their shoes is the first superficial , yet affixed with some glancing meaning , clue we get at their fragile identities . In a theatrically embroidered and embellished way , a podiatrist tries to esoterically reveal the deepest secrets of a woman 's souls by the sole of her feet . The premise is risky and slightly contrived , but the tone and depth of the movie takes a daring plunge for the good . What may have been light-hearted and superficial , quickly switches gear with the a superb dysfunctional couple scene that leaves the viewer riveted for minutes , seeing the love or lack thereof , the pain , the confusion , the hope , the needs and escape mechanisms develop through minutes different rooms of the house and down to the street and eventually below .. What a scene ( ! ) , but there will be others as effective to follow and strengthen the strong characterization and directing displayed in this slice of life affair . Moving along , a woman has lost the husband she loved and inherited his kids and his taxi , while another has completely lost her husband emotionally , sexually , intellectually , but not physically . A ghost , a pending divorce reproach , regret & remorse . A new love ? Can you love a mirage ? Can you love the person in the mirror ? Can you love someone you can't love ? Or think you can't love ? Can you love and live life even though it will always be somewhat hopeless ? Yet isn't it exactly these hopes and dreams that keep us here grounded and in a spectrum of relative happiness ? A lot of deep themes emerge and the final act brings people and ideas together to coalesce in an existential crisis with no clear cut solution , definitive decision or effective healing . Maybe a elusive thought , a fleeting feeling , but a lasting appreciation of life and of the artistry and intellect of the film . Live . Live again . Rewind the reel . Unveil the real , the important ; the big stones ( piedras ) of life . The rest is just details .  
  And I really mean that . I caught it last night on Vh1 , and I was not expecting it to be so good . This is now one of my favorites . I must add that it has a killer soundtrack .  
  Purple Rain .. what else can i say , the title speaks for itself . But i think all the actors were well picked . The movie had a great story . I loved it ! Ever since i watched that movie , i 've been stuck in the eighties , and I 'm only 13 ! My favorite part of the movie was when his father died and he was picking up all of his music compositions , and the Apollonia was sitting on the stairwell with his earing in her hand . Critics say that its a drama but i think its more of a romance . Murphy Brown also did a great job in the movie , he actually acted like himself . I 'm so glad I 've seen this movie . The song Purple Rain , beautifully sung , was so heartfelt . I cried more than once .  
  A delightfully unpretentious send up of Romeo and Juliet . Approach with no expectations other than having a good time and you will enjoy this one . A talented group of comic actors let go and have a riot in this light-hearted performers ' vehicle . Bad reviews were due to a snobbishness about treatments of Shakespeare . Some people feel that all film must be " important " - If you share those views , don't bother . The credits read " introducing " Angelina Jolie , which is not even close to being true , but she is astoundingly beautiful as the Juliet character , and , as always , her acting is wonderful - and , considering her age at the time , even her dialect is pretty good . Recreating this classic tale with feuding Italian families in the catering business in New York results in great fun . See it in the right frame of mind and you will laugh out loud .  
  no movie with dennis hopper , gary busey , erika eleniak , tom berenger , dean stockwell , marilu henner deserves a rating under 5 on here . This is a poor mans version of movies like 16 blocks or the timeless Midnight run except the prisoner being transported here is the very easy on the eye Ms . Eleniak . Tom Berenger plays another gruff , maverick military type well and William Mcnamara plays his rookie-about to be discharged foil well . The plot on the face of it is absurd because I lost count of the times Eleniak should have and could have escaped but this is an entertaining feel-good movie and there are good cameos from all of the above actors that keep the movie rolling . This isn't really a family movie as there is some swearing and a rare nude scene with eleniak but this is a lot better than some of the other guff that came out around this time .  
  One word : suPURRb ! I don't think I have see anything like this in a long time on network or cable television . Watching this show was like taking a breath of fresh air amid TV schedule filled with reality shows and boring re-runs . I have to say I had my reservations . After all , critics were almost unanimous in crying foul and downgrading the show . But when half an hour was over ( by the way , thank you , NBC , for running a commercial-free show ) , I was left with the feeling of instant love , love at first glance , the true love that one feels in his guts . Everything about this show screamed EXCELLENCE . Graphics in this show were at least as good as Finding Nemo and Shrek . No small feat considering those movies took years to be developed . Cast was marvelous . I am partial to John Goodman 's voice , but the rest of the team certainly were on par with John . Special mention : Lisa Kudrow 's guest appearance . She was on top of the game creating neurotic , pudgy , and lovable panda with a Jewish streak in her . ( Panda from Brooklyn ? Only in this show . ) Script was funny , with a lot of inside and adult jokes which were sharp , yet not tacky . A note for all parents : this is NOT for children . This show was never advertised as such , and there 's a reason why it 's set for 9PM , not 8PM . So if you 'd like to complain about " objectionable context " , save your breath . Adults deserve a comedy made just for them , and Father of the Pride is it . Not everything was perfect . I was a bit puzzled by Siegfried and Roy 's characters . Do I sense " stereotype " when it comes to them ? Yes , they are gay . Yes , they are flamboyant . Yes , they speak with German accents . But that 's yesterday 's news . Give us something new , something fresh , something funny . Putting the old jokes in a new show is definitely the wrong approach . I understand that the creators of this show wanted to use the " star power " that these guys have . That 's fine by me . But please don't dwell on something everybody already knows by heart . Hopefully , the rest of the show is not going to play the same old record over and over . In general , the show is definitely a Must-See-TV . Funny , witty , with a few unexpected twists here and there - there haven't been a comedy this good since Seinfeld . I am certainly looking forward to the next episode .  
  I don't know why some people criticise that show so much . It is a great , funny show - probably not the right material for mainstream prime-time , but still .. The family dynamics are funny , and all in all the same you see in most comedy shows . The supporting characters are absolutely hilarious . The plots of the individual episodes and the frequent Siegfried & Roy jibes are only just above average , but ever so often you have sub-plots or one-liners that make you roll on the floor laughing . This show was well worth the 8 Pounds I paid for it . rating : 8/10  
  Another fantastic film from a country , where due to decades of oppression from fundamentalist regimes , has no problems in creating passionate subject matter . Panahi takes a different approach this time around with a blend of ironic comedy and an endearing , non-professional cast . While still getting across his message of what he sees as being inherently wrong with his country , he does so without the need of a heavy storyline . It is a positive take on a country , in particular its people , that the Iranian population desperately need . The greatest pity is it won't be released domestically . The insular , paranoid Iranian government assert that this fine film maker is only successful overseas because he is part of a global conspiracy to embarrass them . After growing up amid revolution and watching the academics , artists and educated ' disappear ' over the last 25 years he shows great bravery in continuing to put his work out there . The realism achieved by shooting at the actual world cup qualifier really transports you to the event . The fact he shot it on 35mm is amazing as most would only attempt this project using a digital format . It looks fantastic . His insistence in only using non-professional actors also really works in this film . Fine performances all round . After watching many films showing the problems Iran has and also the news media reporting the facts we can tend to demonise the people as well as the government . This film does the opposite . It shows us they still love the same things and that by laughing at themselves and the absurd rules of sharia law that maybe a change for the better isn't too far away . Some call Panahi a feminist film maker but I think he just fights for the most oppressed demographic in Iran . Young , independent women .  
  An interesting look at Japan prior to opening to the West . John Wayne as America 's first consul to Japan arrives in accordance with agreements resulting from Perry 's gunboat diplomacy . He is not welcome . Wayne eventually wins his meeting with the Shogun after bring a cholera epidemic , introduced by an American ship , under control . There follows a colorful procession to the capital bearing gifts for the Shogun , including a bottle of Old Tanglefoot . The meeting with the Shogun , the debates among the Japanese nobles and an assassination during an archery exhibit present an interesting look at the politics of the period . Altogether a rather enjoyable movie and besides how often do you get to see the Duke lose a fight to a guy half his size .  
  This movie is great . Simply . It is rare that you find a comedy with levels , and this is a bloody good example of such . When I saw this movie first , as the credit rolled , a friend and I looked to one another and asked .. ' did you just catch that ? ' For those doubters , look at the levels . See the comparisons between Vick and the people in the club , the DNA ! See the diverse characters , each jostling for position , and if you see nothing else , see the connection between the cure of Vick and the path through the film . IT 'S ALL IN VICK 'S HEAD ! The opening line about Vick 's world . The closing scene with the camera going into Vick 's head , and inside , a whole universe ! Thoroughly quotable , wonderful cartoon gangsters , beautiful , beautiful , beautiful !  
  * Ten out of Ten Stars * It 's hard to believe this was a made for television movie . Just the phrase , " made of TV " , makes me shudder . The production values for made for TV movies are almost always remarkably lower than production values for professional movie studios . That being said , this version of the " Christmas Carol " should have been released in theaters , because it IS that good . It 's my personal favorite of all the " Christmas Carol " movies because every aspect of this production are of the highest quality . Yes , there are some minor on screen glitches with two of the ghosts that visit Scrooge , but there isn't a movie in existence that doesn't have at least a couple of mistakes . Scott turns in a stellar performance as Scrooge , he 's a pleasure to watch . In fact , I can't think of one performance in this film that shouldn't be applauded . The costuming , location shooting , and winter backdrop are mesmerizing . The musical score is endearing and heart warming . Add to that , solid directing , flawless cinematography , and faithful scripting ; we have here what will one day be considered a holiday classic . It really hasn't been around long enough to be a classic , but mark my words , one day soon it will be . This film has turned into a yearly Christmas tradition in my home because it embodies the true meaning behind Christmas : Love , selflessness , and giving . In as selfish , greedy world , my family and I can lose ourselves in " The Christmas Carol " , starring George C . Scott .  
  Love hurts . That , I think , is the main message Mike Binder 's newest film Reign Over Me brings across . Whether that love has caused your relationship to become stagnant , or has brought anger from the one you love cheating for years , or has broken your heart to the point of being unable to open yourself up to the world , love hurts . The great thing about this film , however , is not in its portrayal of these lost souls trying to let their past heartbreaks go , but in the eventual restart of new bonds for the future . No one in this drama is perfect ; they are all at some degree trapped emotionally in relationships that they can't free themselves from alone . There is some heavy subject material here and I credit Binder for never making the story turn into a political diatribe , but instead infusing the serious moments with some real nice comedic bits allowing the tale to stay character-based and small in scale compared to the epic event that looms overhead . What could have become a trite vehicle for opinions on how 9-11 effected us all , ends up being a story about two men and a connection they share that is the only thing which can save their lives from a life of depression and regret . This is a new career performance for Adam Sandler . I like to think that my favorite director Paul Thomas Anderson was the first to see the childish , pent-up anger in his stupid comedies as something to use dramatically . The juvenility of a character like Billy Madison allows for laughs and potty humor , but also can be used to show a repressed man , shy and shutout to the world around hima man with no confidence that needs an event of compassion to break him from his shell . Anderson let Sandler do just that in his masterpiece Punch-Drunk Love and Mike Binder has taken it one step further . Sandler plays former dentist Charlie Fineman whose wife and three kids were killed in one of the planes that took down the World Trade Center on 9-11 . That one moment crushed any life that he had and as a result , he became reclusive and started to believe he couldn't remember anything that happened before that day . He really delivers a moving portrait of a man trying to keep up the charade in his head while those around him , those that love him , try and open him up to the reality of what happened and what the future holds . Always on edge and ready to snap at any moment when something is mentioned to spark the memory of his perished family , he goes through life with his iPod and headphones , shutting out everything so as not to be tempted remember . Reign Over Me is not about Charlie Fineman though , it is about dentist and family man Alan Johnson . A man that has trapped himself into a marriage and dental practice that both have stagnated into monotony , Johnson needs as much help in his life as his old college roommate Charlie does . Played perfectly by the always brilliant Don Cheadle , Johnson has lost his backbone to try and change his life . He has no friends and when he sees Charlie , by chance , one day , his life evolves into something he hasn't felt in 15 years . He revels in the chance to go out with an old friend no matter how much he has changed from the death of his family . Cheadle 's character wants to revert back to the college days of hanging out and Sandler 's doesn't mind because all that was before he met his wife . The two men get what they want and allow themselves to grow close despite the years of solitude that used to rule their lives . Once they begin opening up though , it is inevitable that the subject of the tragedy will creep up and test the façade they have created for themselves . The supporting cast does an amazing job helping keep up appearances for the two leads . Jada Pinkett Smith has never been an actress that impressed me and throughout the film played the tough as nails wife nicely , but it is her final scene on the phone with Cheadle that really showed me something different and true . Liv Tyler is a bit out of her element as a psychiatrist , but the movie calls her on this fact and makes the miscasting , perfect casting . The many small cameos are also effective , even writer / director Mike Binder 's role as Sandler 's old best friend and accountant , ( my only gripe here is why he feels the need to put his name in the opening credits as an actor when it is everywhere , considering it is his film ) . Last but not least is the beautiful Saffron Burrows . She is a great actress and plays the love - crushed divorcée trying to put her life back together wonderfully . A role that seems comic relief at first , but ends up being an integral aspect for what is to come . Binder has crafted one of the best dramatic character studies I have seen in a long time . The direction is almost flawless , ( the blurring between cuts and characters in the fore / background really annoyed me in the beginning ) , the acting superb , and the story true to itself , never taking the easy way out or wrapping itself up with a neatly tied bow at the conclusion . Even the music was fantastic and used to enhance , not to lead us emotionally , ( why after two great uses of the titular song by The Who did Binder feel the need to use the inferior Eddie Veddar remake for the end , I don't know , but it did unfortunately stick out for me ) . Reign Over Me is a film about love and how although it can cause the worst pain imaginable , it can also save us from regret and allow us to once again see the world as a place of beauty and hope .  
  Often tagged as a comedy , The Man In The White Suit is laying out far more than a chuckle here and there . Sidney Stratton is an eccentric inventor who isn't getting the chances to flourish his inventions on the world because nobody pays him notice , he merely is the odd ball odd job man about the place as it were . After bluffing his way into Birnley 's textile mill , he uses their laboratory to achieve his goal of inventing a fabric that not only never wears out , but also never needs to be cleaned ! . He is at first proclaimed a genius and those who ignored him at first suddenly want a big piece of him , but then the doom portents of an industry going bust rears its head and acclaim quickly turns to something far more scary . Yes the film is very funny , in fact some scenes are dam hilarious , but it 's the satirical edge to the film that lifts it way above the ordinary to me . The contradictions about the advent of technology is a crucial theme here , do we want inventions that save us fortunes whilst closing down industries ? , you only have to see what happened to the coal industry in Britain to know what I 'm on about . The decade the film was made is a crucial point to note , the making of nuclear weapons became more than just hearsay , science was advancing to frighteningly new proportions . You watch this film and see the quick turnaround of events for the main protagonist Stanley , from hero to enemy in one foul swoop , a victim of his own pursuit to better mankind ! , it 's so dark the film should of been called The Man In The Black Suit . I honestly can't find anything wrong in this film , the script from Roger MacDougall , John Dighton , and director Alex Mackendrick could be filmed today and it wouldn't be out of place such is the sharpness and thought of mind it has . The sound and setting is tremendous , the direction is seamless , with the tonal shift adroitly handled by Mackendrick . Some of the scenes are just wonderful , one in particular tugs on the heart strings and brings one to think of a certain scene in David Lynch 's Elephant Man some 29 years later , and yet after such a downturn of events the film still manages to take a wink as the genius that is Alec Guinness gets to close out the film to keep the viewers pondering not only the future of Stanley , but also the rest of us in this rapidly advancing world . A timeless masterpiece , thematically and as a piece of art , 10/10 .  
  " Deliverance " is a dead-on example of what wonderful movies came out of the ' 70s . While your jaw is dropped during a " Terminator " movie , are you really sacred ? I don't think so , because you are there to see what new CGIs have been strung together - plot matters not . So many daily situations can become terrifying for no reason at all , because there are so many people involved in daily living - like a trip to the market .. or a walk down a dimly-lighted street . " Deliverance " is SO frightening , because those innocent actions can turn deadly in a heart-beat . Venturing into the backwoods is a frolic in fun ? Anyone who has that notion does not read the papers , watch the daily news , nor has not seen some of the other movies that depict the seriousness of " trespassing " into territories where outsiders are not welcome . It is almost unbelievable that the advance dish on " Deliverance " didn't inform almost everyone going to view it this was no picnic , and " squeal like a pig " wasn't a part of " Deulling Banjos " . I hate the term " hillbillies " , because - as some " users " wrote - that demeans entire regions of people who are very content to live as they know how - without the interference of modern life . Much is made of " inbred " - that is not sexuality peculiar to the backwoods . " Chinatown " should teach us that lesson . However , city-slickers are extremely dumb to enter a closed society and give them attitude . I know lots of " hillbillies " - they are moral people , when left to themselves . Their " justice " can be brutal when they feel threatened or humiliated , just like the " justice " in city streets . They don't need any part of the city - the city should take its canoe-ing and camping to legal sites . " Deliverance " was the last film I found Jon Voight to do any real acting - I hope I 'm wrong . He was extremely underpaid for " Midnight Cowboy " , because he was unknown , but demonstrated that he could do that role at the drop of a hat . His acting in " Deliverance " was superb . It gave us a clear demonstration ordinary people can move mountains , if it 's necessary - but who wants to be thought-of as " ordinary " today ? His stifled sob at the dinner was brilliant . Wow ! for Burt Reynolds ! One must ask what led him into those other tacky films ? His manliness , although misguided , in this film set the pace for the endurance necessary to make it out of the wilderness - not only in the backwoods , but the wilderness of everyday-life . Ned Beatty was stellar - his underwear may not have had " Versace " stitched on it , but his shell-shocked performance was perfect . As noted , he became stronger than any of the group by the end of the movie . Ronny Cox played the moral guy to the hilt - every man should have his determination to do what is right . Several " users " have theorized he was shot , or lost his balance when he pitched-into the river - my theory is that he was so disgusted with the whole journey , he committed suicide . No gunshot was heard during the scene and Voight and Beatty did not find a wound . James Dicey certainly knows how to weave a suspenseful tale , and was great as the sheriff - it is said he was so terrified of acting he came to the set drunk every day . His character could see the three canoe-rs were guilty of surviving , but also knew they didn't stand a chance against a jury of the local people , no matter how kindly they were treated in " Aintry " . He was also aware that the meaner of the locals could be cruel . Justice ? - " don't come back up here again " . Not many " users " knew " hillbillies " were used in the film where ever it was possible - what actors could portray them better ? The " mountain-men " WERE actually mountain-men .. Every detail of this movie was perfect - no doubt it was dangerous to play in . Play in ? Better " fight for your life " in . I 've experienced some near-dangerous incidents , and am content to live outside of the fray - you guys who feel your manhood raging can have my part . That we have absolutely killed - and continue to do so - irreplaceable areas of this country in undeniable . To be able to view its grandeur on any media is enthralling , but it leaves a bitter taste to realize some do not care about it . Los Angeles , where I live , is a perfect example : it 's built-up right into the territories for wild animals , and steadfastly believes humans come before animals . Those are their rightful habitats - we should leave them be just that . Any wonder why coyotes and bears and wolves wander into neighborhoods ? They 're theirs . In some less threatening way , we all need to experience the lessons to be learned from " Deliverance " - to understand our advancement technologically does not lead to supremacy . I thank all those city-slickers who went out into the wilderness to produce this modern classic , so that it can scare the heck out of me when I watch it . You can have the thrill of danger - I 'll stick to the TV . 30-out-of-10 .  
  In what is arguably the best outdoor adventure film of all time , four city guys confront nature 's wrath , in a story of survival . The setting is backwoods Georgia , with its forests , mountains , and wild rivers . The director , John Boorman , chose to use local people , not actors , to portray secondary characters . These locals imbue the film with a depth of characterization unequaled in film history . No central casting " actors " could ever come close to these people 's remarkable faces , voices , or actions . I don't recall a film wherein the secondary characters are so realistic and colorful . As much as anything else , it is this gritty realism that makes this film so amazing . Another strength is the film 's theme . Nature , in the wild , can be violent . How appropriate that the setting should be the American South . Very few places in the U.S. are , or have been , as violent as redneck country . In a story about Darwinian survival of the fittest , the film conveys the idea that humans are part of nature , not separate from it . " Deliverance " is very much a product of its time when , unlike today , Americans expressed concern over a vanishing wilderness . The film 's magnificent scenery , the sounds of birds , frogs , crickets , and the roar of the river rapids , combined with the absence of civilization , all convey an environmental message . And that is another strength of the film . At an entertainment level , the tension gradually escalates , as the plot proceeds . Not even half way into the film the tension becomes extreme , and then never lets up , not until the final credits roll . Very few films can sustain that level of intensity over such a long span of plot . Finally , the film 's technical quality is topnotch . Direction and editing are flawless . Cinematography is excellent . Dialogue is interesting . And the acting is terrific . Burt Reynolds has never been better . Ned Beatty is perfectly cast and does a fine job . And Jon Voight should have been nominated for an Oscar . If there is a weak link in the film , it is the music , which strikes me as timid . Overall , " Deliverance " almost certainly will appeal to viewers who like outdoor adventure . Even for those who don't , the gritty characterizations , the acting , and the plot tension are reasons enough to watch this film , one of the finest in cinema history .  
  I loved the story . Somewhere , a poster said there are no families like the one portrayed in this film . Well maybe there ought to be . I thought everybody seemed really human and believable . What a top notch cast . What great music on the soundtrack . What a nice this , and what a nice that , but most of all , I will say two words to recommend this film . Steve Carell . He really showed a nice , subtle depth that touched me . He was truly commanding as a widower who had dedicated himself maybe a little too much to being a good dad first , at the cost of denying his own needs . Did he act like a petulant ass ? Why , yes he did . And you see , that 's what was perfect about this film . The actor who played this character made me believe he was FEELING something , and not simply ACTING like he was feeling something , and he conveyed to me perfectly what it was that he was feeling , and what he was feeling was denied . Denied happiness . Denied fulfillment . Denied love . Losing your love is painful beyond belief , and many who do so will never feel something like that again . Beautiful film . I gave it an eight out of ten .  
  admittedly , I first picked up Ranma 1/2 when I was around twelve . I was in the library and searched desperately for something good to read . Then , I went to the Comic / Manga section and spotted this book . At my first few reads through the chapters I didn't really know what was going on , but I knew that I LOVED it . I even took it home for a few more reads over . Frankly , I wasn't getting anywhere . And then , about five months ( I 'm 16 now ) ago my friend was watching some anime series and I remembered about this Manga . I couldn't remember what it was called , but recalled that the author was Rumiko Takahashi , creator of Inu Yasha . I Googled it , and then made a rash decision to watch all 161 episodes . At first I was a little thrown off by the 1990 graphics , but it didn't really matter in the end . No anime has ever made me laugh so hard and rewind , watch again . I once watched 45 consecutive episodes within a day . I don't know how I did it .. but I couldn't stop . Eventually , after about two days , I grew obsessed . I even dreamt-as crazy as this sounds-about watching Ranma . Never have I found a series so enjoyable , so funny , and so heartwarming to watch . To this day 161 episodes are not enough to keep me satisfied . Of course the cliffhanger ending was enough to make me go bonkers , but the series alone was enough to make me continue reading . Ranma 1/2 is about a boy named Ranma Saotome and his dad Genma Saotome . INTENSE martial artists . They are so intense , that they went to the ancient training grounds in China and became ' cursed ' . The grounds were full of different pools of springs , and if you land in one , you take the shape of whatever drowned there when doused in cold water . For Genma , that was a PANDA , and for Ranma that was a .. girl ! It 's a very crafty fun loving story . On top of that , Genma promises his friend that Ranma will marry one of his daughters to keep the Tendo dojo alive . ' Course the one he gets matched up with hates his guts and the feelings mutual . Obviously they start to like one another , but both way to stubborn to admit it . But .. Genma has a history of doing this . He promised Ranma to many girls . Trust me . It 's worth watching . It 's humorous , heartwarming and all around amazing .  
  WOW . If you think that a film can't fatigue in some way , then you haven't seen Dog Bite Dog . This film pulls no punches , and it doesn't shy away from showing very disturbing images at all . Much like Salo , this one shows us the dehumanization of the human spirit . It is gritty , dark , depressing and hopeless , but it is also one of the best films to ever come out of Hong Kong . The script is much more of the same , but don't go on thinking it is incredibly clichéd . It basically is about a troubling and obsessive detective in a cat and mouse game , against a professional and emotionless hit-man . While the script offers nothing new on the surface , it does provide a lot of questions about the dark side of humanity . Is violence really that necessary ? Do we become more or less human when we abuse a 5 year old child , without pity , without remorse ? In turn , we humans act no less than rabid dogs when we are blinded by anger , this is a sad truth . It is a topic that the director brilliantly explores , without limiting himself at all . Besides the cat and mouse chase , the script also develops two separate story lines for the main characters . One is about love , and the other is about redemption . Even if the script isn't that new , it is still wonderfully written and it keeps you glued to the seat at all times . The acting is really , really good . Edison Chen as the Hit-man is incredible ; he proves that he isn't just any pretty face . He is ruthless , vile and beyond likable . Sam Lee as the obsessed cop is also outstanding . The supporting cast , in short , is excellent . The music is also worth mentioning . Very somber score by Ben Cheung , with some effective light hearted songs played at key dark moments in the film . The cinematography by Yuen Man is also really good . Overall , this CATII film is highly recommended . Very well paced , incredibly acted , marvelously scored and just really good at the end of it all . However , as many have pointed out , this is not a movie for everyone . If you dislike strong violence then you should stay away from this one . If you don't like seeing heavy negativity in film then this isn't for you too . In the end , a powerhouse film , 8/10 .  
  A very close and sharp discription of the bubbling and dynamic emotional world of specialy one 18year old guy , that makes his first experiences in his gay love to an other boy , during an vacation with a part of his family . I liked this film because of his extremly clear and surrogated storytelling , with all this " Sound-close-ups " and quiet moments wich had been full of intensive moods .  
  " Come Undone " appears to elicit a lot of opinions among the contributors to this forum . Granted , it 's a film that promises a take on gay life , as most viewers expect and somehow , it gets away from that promise into an introspective view at a young man 's soul . The film has a way of staying with us even when it has ended . It is a character study about how a young man gets involved into a love affair with someone so much different than him that , in the end , will leave Mathieu confused , hurt and depressed when things don't go according to what he hoped the relationship would be . If you haven't seen the film , perhaps you would like to stop reading . Sebastien Lifshitz , the director of the film , has told his story from Mathieu 's viewpoint . Most viewers appear to be disoriented by the different times within the film , but there are hints that are not obvious , as one can see , in retrospect . The story is told in flashbacks that might add to the way some people will view the film . This is a story about the doomed the love Mathieu felt for Cedric and the ultimate breakdown of their life together . First of all , Cedric , the handsome young local , pursues Mathieu until he succeeds in convincing him he likes him . Mathieu feels the attraction for Cedric too . We realize how different both young men are by the way Cedric tells Mathieu 's family how he feels school is not for him . On the other hand , Mathieu , who wants to be an architect , finds beauty in the abandoned place where Cedric has taken him . We watch as Mathieu , reading from the guide book , wants Cedric 's attention . When Mathieu comes out to his mother , she wisely tells him about the importance of continuing his career . She also points out about what future both of them would have together , which proves to be true . Mathieu appears to have learned his lesson , the hard way . He goes on to an uncertain life with Cedric and attempts to take his own life . We watch him in the hospital speaking to a psychiatrist that has treated his wounded soul . The ending might be confusing for most viewers , but there is a moment in the film when Mathieu goes to work in a bar where we see him washing glasses and looking intently to Pierre , the young man who frequents the bar . That is why when Mathieu goes looking for Pierre at his house , appears to be hard to imagine . Yet , we have seen the way Mathieu is obviously interested in Pierre . The last scene at the beach , when Pierre and Mathieu are seen strolling in the sand , has a hopeful sign that things will be better between them as they watch a young boy , apparently lost , but then realizing the father is nearby . Jeremie Elkaim makes Mathieu one of the most complex characters in recent films . This is a young man who is hard to understand on a simple level . Mathieu has suffered a lot , first with the separation of his parents , then with his depressed mother and with losing Cedric . Stephan Rideau , who has been seen on other important French films , is equally good , as the shallow Cedric . While " Come Undone " will divide opinions , the film deserves a viewing because of the complexity and the care Sebastien Lifshitz gives to the story .  
  2005 Toronto Film Festival Report It is official ; " Takashi Miike " is whacked . The annual midnight screening of the new " Takashi Miike " film , " The Big Spook War " or " The Great Yokai War " or " Yôkai daisensô " . Call it what you will this is a fanatical ride . Colin Geddes , the fearless programmer stated this film was originally geared towards children in Japan . Think of " Lord of the Rings " or " Neverending Story " for Japan . After the screening I can understand where they were going with that , but damn this is " Takashi Miike " after all . He directed the ' 01 film " Ichi the Killer " , when it screening at the festival barf bags were handed out at the screening . And no , that wasn't just a marketing ploy . Plot Summary : A young boy with a troubled home life becomes " chosen , " and he stumbles into the middle of a Great Spirit war , where he meets a group of friendly spirits who become his companions through his journey . This is not really for kids , well not ' too ' young . Certainly see them getting scared shitless with some of these spirits ( even the friendly ones ) on display . This is unlike anything I 've seen in the movie theater before . A fantasy naturally , some very funny ( but dark ) material . You will not be bored can guarantee that . Will this ever hit North America ? Doubtful . My rating = B  
  So you think a talking parrot is not your cup of tea huh ? Well , think again . Paulie is a wonderful film filled with touching moments . The characters are all lovable especially Paulie as he enters the lives of many people on his journey . It is journey worth experiencing . Don't miss it ! It is available on home video .  
  I saw this movie at the theaters when I was about 6 or 7 years old . I loved it then , and have recently come to own a VHS version . My 4 and 6 year old children love this movie and have been asking again and again to watch it . I have enjoyed watching it again too . Though I have to admit it is not as good on a little TV . I do not have older children so I do not know what they would think of it . The songs are very cute . My daughter keeps singing them over and over . Hope this helps .  
  This movie is excellent and I would recommend renting it for anyone whose local video store owns it . Or , even better , you could buy it because chances are you 're going to watch this over and over . I can remember watching this movie as a kid and it was great back then . But after watching it again yesterday I 've found it to be amazing . A good blend of comedy ( although not as great as " Mr Magoo " - another one of my favorites ) and action . This deserves 10/10 and I 'm hoping that they will make a sequel soon ( fingers crossed ) . If you do babysitting or have to look after young children for anything then I 'd recommend renting this movie as it will keep them entertained for hours : ) .  
  With a relatively small budget for an animated film of only $ 60 million the people at Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios have done an incredible job . They have combined state of the art digital animation , the perfectly cast voice talents of Ray Romano , John Leguizamo and Dennis Leary ( among many others ) to create a highly entertaining , family film with a strong message about cooperation , friendship and caring for your fellow herd members . And how sometimes it takes many different creatures to make up a herd . While watching this film I got a strong political message about getting along with the people that share your space - maybe it should be required viewing for all world leaders ! David Newman - yet another member of the Newman family of Hollywood composers - provides a superb score that is not intrusive yet serves to move the action along and , at times , is positively toe tapping . The overall look of the film is incredible ; an intensely coloured , strangely believable fantasyland of snow , geysers , mud , rocks and ice . The individual characters were delightfully believable too , with the facial expressions of Ray Romano 's Manfred ' being a particular treat . The entire sequence with the DoDos will leave no doubt as to where the expression ` Dumb as a DoDo comes from . ' This is a good family film that keeps the things that could alarm or frighten children pretty much sanitized - but real nonetheless . It would be a great movie to see in the theater and to buy for home .  
  Poor geeky Marty ( Simon Scuddamore ) gets horribly burned due to a cruel April Fool 's day stunt gone very wrong . Flash forward a decade and those involved ( including Caroline Monroe , known to horror fans for her turns in Maniac , Faceless & the Last Horror Film ) in the prank are psyched for the upcoming 10 year high school reunion not aware that a court jester-masked killer is hiding out in the ( now closed down ) school and out for revenge . Chaulk this one up to being a guilty pleasure , I knew it 's a bad film . It has all the characteristics of one . Yet there 's just something about it that makes me feel compelled to watch it from time to time ( preferably with beer in hand ) . I 'm even willing to overlook the absolutely horrid ending ( which , I do have to say , I hate ) I guess I like it because it has a fun atmosphere about it and some pretty cool kills . Eye Candy ( for the men ) : Josephine Scandi & Donna Yeager both get topless Eye Candy ( for the ladies ) : a gratuitous cock shot of Simon Scuddamore at the start of the film My Grade : B- Lionsgate DVD Extras : Optional trivia track ; trailer for this film ; and trailers for My Bloody Valentine ( 1981 ) , Monster Squad , Dirty Dancing  
  I 'm totally surprised by some of the comments on this forum , and many of the reviews . I think Tony Scott made a good movie here . Yes , it is highly stylized , flashy and over the top , but it is very entertaining . I 'm glad at least Ebert and Roeper agrees with me : ) This movie may not be for anyone , but if you like over-the-top , dark humor , cool action and dialog , you should see it . I 've previously seen Scott 's Man on Fire , Crimson Tide and Enemy of the State - all good movies , but I like this one more . It 's like a roller-coaster ride , with great soundtrack selections , visual styles and in a time when all movies seem to be pg13 , it is nice to see that someone isn't afraid of showing nudity , gory violence , and have explicit dialog . It doesn't hurt that Keira is super-hot , and even shows nipples in this one , either ..  
  My name is Domino Harvery . { EDIT * dizzying * CHOP } My-my-my name is Domino Harvey . { CUT , CHOP } My name is Domino Harvey . { EDIT . CUT . Playback } Never have I seen a director take so much flack for his style before . By now it is evident that most people do not appreciate Tony Scott 's choppy , flashy , dizzying editing technique . If I have to choose between loving it and hating it , I 'd say I love it . It was borderline distracting at times , but the end result was pretty good and it 's nice to see a director with a creative edge to his style and some originality ( even if it borrows heavily from MTV videos ) . This stylistic edge manifests itself as Keira Knightley plays the role of cocky badass bounty hunter Domino Harvey and even her dialogue seems strangely choppy . Otherwise she plays her poorly because I pretty much hated her character and did not sympathize one bit with her , no matter how much she suffered . We follow Domino through her life as she joins up with fellow bounty hunters Mickey Rourke , Rizwan Abbasi and Edgar Ramirez . The crew become tangled up in the FBI and suddenly has a reality show contract under Christopher Walken 's TV production company ( what is Christopher Walken doing in every film , by the way ? ) . I guess that is a clever film technique , because now Tony Scott is free to use as much flashy MTV / Reality Show editing footage as he likes . It becomes a pastiche of MTV culture at this point . It followes then that the story is told at an amazingly rapid-fire pace , with lots of raunchy strong language and gun violence . There are some funny jokes ; it 's all very modern and surreal at the same time . It 's a mess , but it 's a rather enjoyable mess . It is ultimately flawed in so many ways ( the actors try too hard to make their characters " cool " , for one ) but it works . I give it a weak 7/10 which may seem generous when compared to the general consensus of movie-goers who graded this film  but I feel it had some good ideas and executed them well . 7 out of 10  
  I watch them all . It 's not better than the amazing ones ( _ Strictly Ballroom _ , _ Shall we dance ? _ ( Japanese version ) , but it 's completely respectable and pleasingly different in parts . I am an English teacher and I find some of the ignorance about language in some of these reviews rather upsetting . For example : the " name should scream don't watch . ' How she move . ' Since when can movie titles ignore grammar ? " There is nothing inherently incorrect about Caribbean English grammar . It 's just not Canadian standard English grammar . Comments about the dialogue seem off to me . I put on the subtitles because I 'm a Canadian standard English speaker , so I just AUTOMATICALLY assumed that I would have trouble understanding all of it . It wasn't all that difficult and it gave a distinctly different flavour as the other step movies I have seen were so American . I loved that this movie was set in Toronto and , in fact , wish it was even more clearly set there . I loved that the heroine was so atypically cast . I enjoyed the stepping routines . I liked the driven Mum character . I felt that many of the issues in the movie were addressed more subtly than is characteristic of dance movies . In summary , if you tend to like dance movies , then this is a decent one . If you have superiority issues about the grammar of the English standard you grew up speaking , your narrow mind may have difficulty enjoying this movie .  
  Sure this was a remake of a 70 's film , but it had the suspense and action of a current film , say Breakdown . He 's running , desperate to be with his hospitalized wife , the police are the least concern . The chases were very good , the part with him being cornered at a rest stop was well done , the end of the movie was a great cliffhanger . This is better than Bullitt , a boring movie with what , a muscle car chase that was filmed badly ? Vigo 's character knew what he had to do to escape Johnny Law , few movies had the effects-night vision , CB radio-okay I forgot the name of the movie , guy has 76'Caddy souped up , toys with guy he upset . The ending is great , you can't tell if he fakes his suicide or not , a very good did he make it or not .  
  A worn-out plot of a man who takes the rap for a woman in a murder case + the equally worn-out plot of an outsider on the inside who eventually is shut out . With such an outstanding case , one would think the film would rise above its hackneyed origins . But scene after scene drones by with no change in intensity , no character arcs , and inexplicable behavior . The homosexuality theme was completely unnecessary - or on the other hand , completely unexplored . It seemed to be included only to titillate the viewers . When will Hollywood learn that having gay characters does not automatically make a more compelling picture ? A regrettably dreadful movie . When will Lauren Bacall pick a good one ? I expected better of her and Kristin Scott Thomas . This one is definitely one to miss .  
  The storyline was okay . Akshay Kumar was good as always and that was the only good thing about the movie . Kareena Kapoor looked bad . There was so hue and cry over her size zero but she did not looked good leaner . I don't know why the hell did Anil Kapoor accepted such a bad role . There was nothing much to do for him in the movie . Just because it is a Yashraj film does not means that an actor should accept the role however bad it is . Said Ali khan was alright . I think that it is high time that Indian directors and producers start thinking of Indian customers as intelligent lot . What are we ? fools ! What do they think , they will show 2 men taking on a SWAT squad to teeters and we will believe them . Is the Indian police so stupid that they are trying to nab some criminals .. they take an entire squad of 100 + policemen and no one was there to surround the palace . The action was crap and I have never seen such bad action . Akshay Kumar was between a circle of 30-40 policemen all shooting at him .. and he shooting back at them . None of the policemen 's bullet touched him but he killed all the policemen . Crap . CRAP . I think the fight director who thought of this scene should take retirement . I strongly recommend NOT TO SEE THIS MOVIE .  
  I would have liked to write about the story , but there wasn't any . I would have liked to quote a couple of hard hitting dialogs from the movie but " hinglish " is only funny for like 5 minutes , after that its overkill . I would have liked to swoon over the ' keep-u-guessing suspense ' but it was as predictable as .. um mm , a Yash raj movie ( ? ) . I would have liked to talk of the edge of the seat action , but I don't like cartoons much . * sigh * All in all , this movie is perfect for : 1 . people attempting suicide - I promise it 'll push you over the edge 2 . Sado-masochists - this movie is way more effective than the barbed wire that Silas guy in the Da-Vinci code wore . 3 . People researching alternative ways to spread terrorism - I swear the audience leaving the hall seemed to be in a mood to kill someone 4 . Movie Piraters : More power to them . If any movies deserves to not have the audience spending money to watch - this is it . 5 . Barnacles , most types of plankton & green algae - Because almost all other living things would require an IQ factor somewhat greater than what the movie offers . Afterthought : The director of the movie , obviously , is a species of his own . ( And i hope to god that he is the only one of his kind .. one is enough ) Things that could have made this a better movie : 1 . A story 2 . A choreographer 3 . A Screenplay writer 4 . A stunt coordinator 5 . A story ( Did I already say that ? ) 6 . A director - preferably one who is not mentally challenged ( although even one who was challenged could have done a better job ) 7 . Anil Kapoor = Bubonic plague - Avoid at all costs 8 . A statutory warning - " Watching Yash Raj movies is Injurious to your mental health " ? Things I liked about the movie : 1 . Kareena Kapoor - For obvious reasons 2 . The English sub-titles - " Mera Dil Kho Gaya " becomes - " My heart is in a void " , " Chaliya Chaliya Chaliya " turns into " Im a flirt , Im a lover , Im a vagabond " .. priceless . In short , Tashan to me , is like the opposite of a Rubrics cube - The cube is supposed to increase the IQ of the player , Tashan promises to lower your IQ , and that .. in a mere 2.5 hours ! Woot ! * sigh * .. But thats just me . I could be wrong You 've been warned anyways .  
  I 've now written reviews for several of the MoH episodes , and this is among the worst . An interesting premise at the beginning is completely abandoned by the time the credits roll . If watching people things they never would in real life amuses you ( " let 's check out the basement ! " ) , then this is your show . Except , it 's not amusing or entertaining - it 's just annoying . The extent of the virus is never , ever showed . I can very much overlook the fact that it affects men only , as the resulting situation is very , very frightening . But then things deteriorate as daughter lets OBVIOUSLY deranged dad into the home , and ultimately dies at his hands . The woman flees north , and runs into a few tens situations . Then , some sort of spirit or alien or something appears and saves her ( things that make you go HUH ? ) . Or something . Then , she is huddling for warmth . The end . Awful . These directors are mailing this tripe in .  
  A cowboy sympathetic to the plight of a nearby Indian tribe is wrongly accused in the rape and murder of the chief 's daughter , leading to much hate and violence . This crackpot nudie feature is fun to look at , though thoroughly impossible to defend on any artistic level . The terrible costumes and the fact that all the Indians are obviously white , makes this look more like a live action cartoon than the serious production that it 's press materials pretends it to be . In short , the plentiful nudity ( the real reason for watching this ) is good . Everything else is not . There 's definitely better examples of both genres . More interesting is that The Ramrodder was filmed at the infamous Spahn Movie Ranch and features not one , but two members of the Manson family , Catherine Share and Bobby Beausoleil , who was probably already in the can for murder at the time this hit the soda-stained screens of the Pussycat Theater !  
  I cannot believe that this movie was ever created . I think at points the director is trying to make it an artistic piece but this just makes it worse . The zombies look like they applied too much eye makeup . The zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes . Finally , there are maybe five or six zombies total , definitely not a nation . The best part of the movie , if there is one is definitely the credits because the painful experience was finally finished . Again to reiterate other user comments , the voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie . Also , there is a scene with a snake and a romanian girl that just does not make sense at all . It is never explained .  
  Unless you are mentally ill or the most die hard segal fan you will tire of this horrendous excuse for a film in under 5 minutes . The Plot - Even for a Seagal film , the plot is just stupid . I mean its not just bad , its barely coherent . The Acting - Unbelievably wooden . Literally seen better acting in porno 's . Ironically this film tries to cash in on this audience which a ' lesbian love scene ' which is utterly cringe-worthy . Special Effects - wouldn't look out of place in a 60 's sword and sorcery flick . Unless you suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all other cures , don't make the same mistake as i did and buy this DVD , as you will be asking for that hour and a half of your life back .  
  As Steven Segal movies go this one is bottom of the barrel . His best was just fodder for bored teenagers . This one tips the scales , then falls off . The characters are all cardboard . The story is double lame . I can't spoil it by telling you the ending . You already know how all Steven Segal movies end if you have seen one . Here goes . He is a super-dooper government agent who know too much to turn loose so they decide , instead of killing him , to dope his brain until he don't remember squat . He escapes , of course , gets arrested and is located by his old general who needs his one man in a million experience to get back a stealth plane that has been handed over to a terrorist gang in Afghanastan by a rogue Air Force pilot who , surprise , surprise , Segal trained . All the heroes , except Segal 's character and his dusky girlfriend , die heroically and Steve-Baby save the whole world in one swell foop , or fell swoop . Whatever . Made with some surplus Air Force and Navy flying film . And a lot of boom-booms . Get some Popeye cartoons instead .  
  One of the lamer wedding movies you 'll see . Smacks too too much of its time period so it was out of date before it hit the theaters . The ethnic stereotypes are like a Henny Youngman joke , except they just aint in the least bit funny here . Molly Ringwald , well what else needs to be said . Give you a clue to the silliness , she destroys a $ 10,000 wedding dress , because " It just won't be me " makes it into this rag , with straps and puts on a top hat , and everyone smiles cutely at her moxy , rather than ringwalding her neck . Its a helluva a cast too , check out how heavy Ally Sheedy is . Wheew !  
  When Sam Peckinpah 's superlative THE WILD BUNCH ( 1969 ) opened the door to outrageous displays of graphic cinematic ultra-violence , it did so with a talented ( if whisky-marinated ) hand guiding the camera and had a compelling story with characters who had actual depth , but in no time flat there were scores of imitators that fell far from the benchmark set by Peckinpah 's epic , and SOLDIER BLUE definitely falls into that category . SOLDIER BLEW , er , BLUE tells the story of foul-mouthed New Yorker Cresta Lee ( Candice Bergen ) a blonde proto-hippie chick who 's been " rescued " from two years of " captivity " among the Cheyenne and is now being sent to a fort where she 'll be reunited with the fiancée she only wants to marry for his money . Also on board the wagon she 's traveling in is a shipment of government gold , cash the Cheyenne need to buy guns with , so in short order the soldiers are wiped out and Cresta flees to the hills , accompanied by Honus Gant ( Peter Strauss ) , the lone surviving cavalryman . Calling Gant by the snarky nickname " Soldier Blue , " Cresta demonstrates that her years among the " savages " was time well spent , outstripping Gant in survival skills , common sense , and sheer balls , and over their journey toward the fort they must persevere against the elements , a band of hostile Kiowa , an unscrupulous trader  played by Donald Pleasance , here giving one of his most ridiculous performances , and that 's saying something  and , in the tradition of many previous western-set romantic comedies , each other . During the course of their misadventures the two opposites are inevitably  and predictably  attracted to each other and eventually end up getting it on  while Gant has a freshly - treated bullet wound that went clean through his leg , no less  in what was surely the only conveniently located cave for at least a twelve mile radius that wasn't filled with rattlesnakes , mountain lions , or who knows what , to say nothing of the Cheyenne , who could have done something really spiffy with such a primo apartment ( there I go , thinking in NYC real estate terms again ) . Realizing that their love could never flourish outside of the cave , Cresta leaves Gant and makes it to the fort by herself only to discover that the moron in charge won't spare a couple of men so they can rescue Gant ; the regiment needs all available personnel to launch an attack on the nearby Cheyenne village , and once Cresta gets wind of that she slips past her obnoxiously horny hubby-to-be and makes a beeline straight to the Cheyenne to warn them of what 's coming . What happens next is what gained the film its infamy ; it turns out that all the wacky misadventures and squabbling were all just a lead-in to a hideous reenactment of the 1864 Sand Creek Massacre , an orgy of rape , torture and general sadistic evil perpetrated in the name of " keeping the country clean , " and almost forty years after its release this sequence still disturbs and nauseates for its sheer cruelty . Children are trampled beneath the hooves of charging horses or impaled on bayonets , unarmed people are beheaded  a nice effect , I have to admit  women are stripped and pawed by gangs of slavering brutes , then raped and mutilated  in one truly sickening instance a naked native woman puts up too much of a fight , so her rapist instead decides to cut off her breasts , which we thankfully only see the start of before the camera moves on to chronicle some other hideous act  and scores of innocent people are shot and dismembered , their compone nt parts impaled on pikes and waved about in victorious celebration or kept as the most ghoulish of souvenirs . No joke , this scene would instantly garner an NC-17 rating if released today , to say nothing of possibly spurring Native American interest groups to riot in the streets over the incredibly exploitative manner in which the atrocities are depicted . I 'm all in favor of westerns that don't shy away from honest portrayals of how the west was won , or stolen if truth be told , but this film has no idea of what kind of movie it wants to be ; one minute it 's a heavy-handed pseudo-hippy lecture about how the treatment of the natives was totally effed up ( well , DUH ! ) , then it 's a light-hearted battle of the sexes farce wherein Cresta proves herself five times the man Gant is and manages to look hot in her tasty red calico poncho ( with no undies ) , but that all goes out the window when Donald Pleasance shows up with an unintentionally ( ? ) hilarious pair of buck-toothed dentures and our heroes must figure out how to escape from his murderous clutches in a sub-plot that goes nowhere , all of which culminates in the aforementioned apocalyptic climax . Any one of those tacks would have been okay for a coherent film , but the end result is a slapdash mess that milked the horrors of its final ten minutes for all they were worth in the film 's promotion and poster imagery . But by trying to be all things to all audiences , SOLDIER BLUE ends up as an incoherent , preachy Mulligan stew of presumably well-intentioned political correctness , but if they were going to tell the story of the Sand Creek Massacre , wouldn't it have been a good idea to have some Indian characters who were more than just walk-ons with Murphy Brown acting as their mouthpiece ? We get to know absolutely nothing of the people who get wiped out solely for what appears to be a crass ploy to lure gorehound moviegoers into seeing " the most savage film in history . " If you , like me , were intrigued by the provocative ads and reviews that shower almost endless praise upon it for its " daring to tell it like it was , " take my word for it and let SOLDIER BLUE slowly fade into cinematic obscurity .  
  I 'm basing this on my observations of one episode I saw last night ( 9/27/06 ) . I don't think I 'll be watching again . The acting was totally wooden , the plot completely predictable , the ending totally unrealistic - I mean who would believe a 30 million dollar judgment for the death of a recovering drug addict with terminal cancer ? The lead actor ( Victor Garber ) seemed so uncomfortable , almost embarrassed in his role - perhaps he realized how bad the writing was ! I fully realize that the drama offered this season is pretty poor , but they can surely find better writers . Maybe they are outsourcing the writing to India or China ! I 'll bet we won't be seeing this one next season !  
  Absolutely fantastic . Now , before a legion of cinema purists choke on their lattés , allow me to elaborate . Much as I enjoyed it , this is quite simply one of the worst films I have ever seen and is certainly the worst film I 've seen at the cinema ( an impressive claim , as I remember seeing Daredevil on the big screen ) . The two leads ( Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert ) were unconvincing at best and downright awful at worst . Of course , they weren't helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a Daphne & Celeste single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the OJ defence . The plot ( to stretch the term slightly ) was thin to non-existent and the ' gore ' scenes , whilst undoubtedly brutal , were irrelevant and laughably formulaic . What plot there is revolves around a twenty-something model ( Cuthbert ) who is abducted , imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures , both psychological and physical . The torture scenes feel like disconnected set pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking rather than scaring the audience . Whilst there really are very , very few positives to draw from this film , its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a dreadful film . I have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema . Within twenty minutes , the entire cinema was in stitches and remained that way throughout . For my part I came out flushed with laughter , buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of appalling film-making . Whichever way you look at it , this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how not to make a film . P.S. I omitted to mention that I managed to get in to the film free .. so I can afford to laugh about it . I was still tempted to ask for my money back .. it really was THAT bad .  
  I expected alot from this movie . Kinda like Lee as a Naustradamous like caracter but instead all I got was a waste of time and a boring movie . I can't even explain this movie . It had wooden acting , terrible script from pieces from the Bible like hurricanes , tidal waves and earthquakes . But that was at the end ! The rest of it I had to wait and hope that something meaningfull would happen but it didn't . This movie is about a couple that tries to find out the changes going on in the world like places in China where there was an earthquake and end up at a convent run by eight nuns and a priest . The convent end up being the key to the misshappenings . The whole movie is missleading and boring . One of Lees worst .  
  " A scientist discovers signals from space that appear to carry information concerning a series of seemingly unrelated natural disasters , occurring across the globe . Hoping to discover the source of these signals and who 's behind them , the scientist and his wife set out on a trek to locate the intended recipient of the signals . What the couple eventually discovers is a small remote convent with occupants who are not really who they appear to be , " according to the DVD sleeve 's synopsis . Kirk Scott ( as Andrew Boran ) is the scientist who intercepts alien messages on his computer . He suspects a series of " Large Earth Disruptions " may be connected to the weird space static . Mr . Scott and pretty blonde wife Sue Lyon ( as Sylvia Boran ) investigate the mysterious signals from outer space . They discover priestly , but creepy Christopher Lee ( as " Father Pergado " ) , and other silliness . Given that , " End of the World " is remarkably dull . * End of the World ( 1977 ) John Hayes ~ Kirk Scott , Sue Lyon , Christopher Lee  
  SPOILER ALERT In this generic and forgettable action movie , Lorenzo Lamas does his usual tough guy / pretty boy act , and his future real life ex Kathleen Kinmont is ass kicking hot chick Alexa . OJ Simpson is a detective , coasting by on his since vanished genial public persona . Translation : cable TV filler . There isn't enough skin to qualify this as a Guilty Pleasure . The script has some gaping holes . Best / Worst Moment : In one jarring scene , OJ 's partner expresses his aversion to the morgue . OJ responds that some of the bodies are pretty hot , or words to that effect . This vague necrophilia reference is offensive enough ; but in light of the murders committed shortly after this movie was released , it is truly appalling , and therefore entertaining in an unintentional , horrible way . I was so startled that I laughed until champagne came out of my nose . Now THAT 'S a Guilty Pleasure . BC  
  Horrible acting , horrible cast and cheap props . Would 've been a lot better if was set as an action parody style movie . What a waste . Starting from the name of the movie . " The Enemy " Naming it " Action Movie " would 've made it better . ( contributing to the parody effect ) . The cop looking like a 60 Year old player , the blond girl just having the same blank boring look on her face at all times . Towards the end of the movie him and her are working together to take down the bad guys and every time they exchange words it just feels like the cheap lines given before a sex scene in a porn movie . Horrible . Don't waste your time .  
  As a writer I find films this bad making it into production a complete slap in the face . Talk about insulting . I was writing better stories than this in 8th grade . Bad acting , bad writing , bad directing and when added all together the result is complete and total failure . The only thing this movie manages to accomplish is tricking the unsuspecting consumer into wasting their time . Who would green light something so poorly written ? It 's not artistic , clever , smart , suspenseful , mysterious , scary , dramatic-NOTHING . The characters are flat and boring with no development . The plot is as recycled as an aluminum can . They somehow managed to cast a few very familiar actors who all must be pretty desperate for work or hoping one of these low budget independent movies will turn out to be the next " Pulp Fiction " . This script should have been used to line a bird cage , not a movie . Oh and last but not least , a 5'2 105 lb woman of course has the strength to kill men and women twice her size without a struggle and in a single blow . Avoid this bomb like it will infect you with an STD .  
  Film starts in 1840 Japan in which a man slashes his wife and her lover to death and the commits suicide . It 's a very gory , bloody sequence . Then it jumps to present day .. well 1982 to be precise . Ted ( Edward Albert ) , wife Laura ( Susan George ) and their annoying little kid move to Japan for hubby 's work . They rent a house and-surprise ! surprise-it just happens to be the house where the murders took place ! The three dead people are around as ghosts ( the makeup is hysterically bad ) and make life hell for the family . Sounds OK-but it 's really hopeless . There 's a bloody opening and ending and NOTHING happens in between . There is an attack by giant crabs which is just uproarious ! They look so fake-I swear I saw the strings pulling one along-and they 're muttering ! There 's a pointless sex sequence in the first 20 minutes ( probably just to show off George 's body ) , another one about 40 minutes later ( but that was necessary to the plot ) and a really silly exorcism towards the end . The fight scene between Albert and Doug McClure must be seen to be believed . As for acting-Albert was OK as the husband and McClure was pretty good as a family friend . But George-as always-is terrific in a lousy film . She gives this film a much needed lift-but can't save it . I 'm giving this a 2 just for her and the gory opening and closing . That aside , this is a very boring film .  
  Warning : This review contains minor spoilers . Well the writers of the first Tremors are officially out of ideas . I 'm a big fan of the first movie and the first two sequels are pretty good for straight to video fare . Tremors 4 : The Legends Begins , however , is a very dull movie . Where the heck are the Graboids ? Due to the relative lack of Graboids through the first 90 minutes I 'm convinced that this entry into the series is suppose to be a " character study " . Unfortunately there isn't one interesting character in the movie except for Billy Drago 's character who is given too few lines , too little to do and in the end too little screen time . What saved the 2nd and 3rd movies was the presence of Michael Gross as Burt Gummer . Whenever there wasn't any action on the screen you could rest assured that Burt Gummer was going to be interesting to listen too and / or watch . However in this movie Gross plays Hiram Gummer a very poor and boring substitute . On the plus side when the Graboids ( Dirt Dragons in this movie ) are on the screen they do look good but that is about as good as it gets . I was impressed when I saw that Tremors 4 was listed at 101 minutes long . Pretty good for straight to video . But after watching it I 'm sure that this movie is a good 15 minutes too long . There are long stretches of dialogue that is boring and doesn't further the plot any . Was there a rush to get this movie made ? I think not , more time could have and should have been spent on the script . I thought I had hit a gold mine when I saw Tremors 4 packaged for sale with .. Tremors ! What luck I thought , pay for # 4 get # 1 for free . Well after watching Tremors 4 I like to think I paid for the original and got this mess for free , I can't imagine paying a single dime for Tremors 4 . For fans of the series it 's best to forget that Tremors 4 : The Legend Begins even exists . Tremors 4 : The Legend Begins rates a 3 out of 10 .  
  This is an extremely silly and little seen film about slavery in the West Indies and it stars Puddy from the " Seinfeld " show ! Patrick Warburton made his film debut in this contrived movie and he 's noticeably slimmer here . Oliver Reed got top billing but he 's hardly in the film at all . Warburton plays a white slave and its funny to see all the young and horny wives of rich old men bidding on him because they all want to have sex with him . Eartha Kitt plays an owner of a bordello and they 're is so much nudity in the film . If its not drunken orgies at the bordello then its the young wives having they 're turn with him . Then of course towards the end the slaves revolt and there 's the bloody standoff . No real political message like the film " Burn " but just another contrived plot device to move the story along . Incredibly they made a sequel and Warburton and all the rest of the cast came back ! I hope they got paid a lot of dough because this first film is pretty bad . The nudity keeps it watchable and Warburton 's lack of any accent make it at times laughable . Very bad film but I got to admit that I want to see the sequel .  
  The Omega Code was a model of cinematographical inconsistency . There was a bit ( but precious little ) of good acting , primarily by the two prophets and Rostenberg , who only appeared once and had no lines . Otherwise the acting was decidedly bad . The plot line was rather weak , and only partially based on already questionable Biblical interpretation . Certainly not one of the year 's best .  
  Apparently , The Mutilation Man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of self-mutilation as a way of coping with his abusive childhood . I use the word ' apparently ' because without listening to a director Andy Copp 's commentary ( which I didn't have available to me ) or reading up on the film prior to watching , viewers won't have a clue what it is about . Gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be lured into watching The Mutilation Man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling real-life footage , but unless they 're also fond of pretentious , headache-inducing , experimental art-house cinema , they 'll find this one a real chore to sit through . 82 minutes of ugly imagery accompanied by dis-chordant sound , terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue , this mind-numbingly awful drivel is the perfect way to test one 's sanity : if you 've still got all your marbles , you 'll switch this rubbish off and watch something decent instead ( I watched the whole thing , but am well aware that I 'm completely barking ! ) .  
  I bought this movie for 1 euro , not knowing what it was all about . I thought " hmm , a movie named mutilation man must be if not very funny at least filled with gore " . It wasn't funny alright . It was disturbing . Very disturbing . And I don't mind disturbing movies but this one just didn't mean anything , except that child abuse is not a good thing to do . hmm .. The quality of the images were terrible . The acting .. there was no acting . Just some fcked-up fcker mutilating himself for over 90 minutes . This is probably material for sicko 's jurking off on extreme gore . Don't watch this . It 's not worth your time . Its just awful . I wish i never bought this . They should mutilate the guy who made this  
  You can give JMS and the boys a pass on this one because they were at the beginning of their series and on a small budget , but the movie is still sub-par . Dont get me wrong , B5 the series is by far the best TV series ever , but if i was an exec seeing this movie , i wouldnt have ordered the series . I dont like O'Hare as an actor , the costumes are silly , and there are tons of cliches . The same can be said for most of the first season ( with the exception of Babylon Squared and Survivors ) ; Bruce immediately put a fire into the series and it went on to be an amazing spectacle . If you are a B5 fan and havent seen this movie , see it . If you arent a B5 fan , dont .. you wont want to watch the series .  
  I saw this last week after picking up the DVD cheap . I had wanted to see it for ages , finding the plot outline very intriguing . So my disappointment was great , to say the least . I thought the lead actor was very flat . This kind of part required a performance like Johny Depp 's in The Ninth Gate ( of which this is almost a complete rip-off ) , but I guess TV budgets don't always stretch to this kind of acting ability . I also the thought the direction was confused and dull , serving only to remind me that Carpenter hasn't done a decent movie since In the Mouth of Madness . As for the story - well , I was disappointed there as well ! There was no way it could meet my expectation I guess , but I thought the payoff and explanation was poor , and the way he finally got the film anti-climactic to say the least . This was written by one of the main contributors to AICN , and you can tell he does love his cinema , but I would have liked a better result from such a good initial premise . I took the DVD back to the store the same day !  
  I was very skeptical about sacrificing my precious time to watch this film . I didn't enjoy the first one at all , and the last Jean Claude Van Damme film I liked was Blood Sports ! After managing to sit through it all ? Avoid , avoid , avoid !  
  This is the official sequel to the ' 92 sci-fi action thriller . In the original , Van Damme was among several dead Vietnam War vets revived to be the perfect soldiers ( Unisols ) . In this one , it 's , I guess , about a dozen years later , since Van Damme has a daughter about that age . Now he 's working with the government in a classified installation to train the latest Unisols - codenamed Unisol 2500 , for some reason . As usual , something goes wrong : the on-site super-computer ( named Seth - like the snake in " King Cobra " the same year ) goes power-crazy , takes command of the Unisols , and even downloads its computer brain into a new super-Unisol body ( Jai White ) . We 're lookin ' at the next step in evolution , folks ! Most of Van Damme 's fights are with one particularly mean Unisol ( pro wrestler Goldberg ) who just keeps on comin ' : drop him off a building - no good ; run him down with a truck - no go ! Shoot him , burn him - forgetaboutit ! Much of the humor is traced to how Van Damme is now outmoded and out-classed ( he 's even going grey around the edges ) . But , though he takes a lickin ' , he keeps on kickin ' ! Most sequels of this sort are pretty lame - pale imitations of the originals , and while this one is certainly no stroke of genius , it manages to be consistently entertaining , especially if you 're a pro-wrestling fan .  
  I actually have a fondness for Christopher Lee , but this just wasn't up to his other performances .. and he was one of the better actors . The film does not live up to its premise . It 's not that scary , it 's overly melodramatic , and it draags . Every time I thought , " Oh , HERE comes the good part " the good part never quite arrived . The Evil Ones aren't at all convincing . Most of the other characters were also lacking in depth . Perhaps if I 'd been in the proper frame of mind , I might have enjoyed some MSTie-fication at this film 's expense , but .. Naahh .. Didn't really seem to be worth the effort . It wasn't really very good , it wasn't really very bad , it was just mediocre .  
  I have seen some bad movies ( Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me , Batman Forever ) , but this film is so awful , so BORING , that I got about half way through and could not bear watching the rest . A pity . Boasting talent such as Kenneth Branagh , Embeth Davitz and Robert Duvall and a story by John Grisham , what went wrong ? Branagh is a big-time lawyer who has a one-night fling with Davitz . Her father ( Duvall ) is a psychopath who hanged her cat , etc , etc , so Branagh has him sent to a nuthouse , and he promptly escapes . Somehow ( I couldn't figure out how ) Robert Downey jr , Daryl Hannah , Famke Janssen and Tom Berenger are all mixed into the story which moves slower than stationary . I wanted to like this , and , being a huge Grisham fan , have read all about this movie and I ( foolishly ) expected something interesting . This is honestly the WORST film I 've seen to date and I wish I could have my money refunded . * out of * .  
  Not only was this the most expensive Canadian film ever shot in BC , but easily the worst , never seeing the light of day . The director is not even Canadian , but British , and boy does it show . We are all made out to be a bunch of over-sexed dope fiends and morons . The spirit of what it means to be Canadian is absent , and this is supposed to be the reason we fund this bunk . Of course the British character is normal . The rest are a crop of sitcom stereotype - can you say " Norm ! " ? The cinematography ranges from pretty postcard images to murky indoor silhouettes . The actors always seem to be fidgetting . Are they as bored as the viewer , or is this the directors idea of cinema ? Avoid this mess and check out some of Bruce Mcdonalds films . A true Canadian boy with something original to say cinematically . You won't be compelled to walk out on HIS films after 10 minutes .  
  Characters you don't care about , relationships you don't care about and you sit through all that to see the ending you knew was coming from the start . Julia Roberts usually leaves no impression on me one way or the other . She was actually somewhat endearing in this role .  
  This is the worst film I have ever seen . I was watching this film with some friends and after 40 minutes we had enough . The plot was bad and there wasn't a single likeable character . I could get more entertainment watching static . I gave this movie a 1 only because the scale didn't go into negative numbers . Avoid this movie at all costs .  
  The first half of this version was the best I 've seen ( and I think I 've seen every version of Jane Eyre ever made ) . The development of Jane 's childhood and character were exceptional . Then , it was as though someone said " Uh oh , this is running too long , " and hacked the rest of the story to shreds . The major scenes , when included at all , are glossed over , combined , and put out of order in such a way that they completely change the storyline . There was so little transition or even scene development that it would be difficult for anyone not familiar with the story even to follow . The big disappointment was that the beginning opened so much hope , and then the end dashed it .  
  My guess is that this director / writer had something to say . Let 's see , what it could have been .. a . Frog storms would be creepy ? b . can I get someone like Tom Cruise to say the " C " word many times and look like a bad Patrick Rafter ? c . Cast my wife and get her to say the " F " word every 2 seconds . This aside I really liked the beginning and the frog storm . The rest was a relentless , over-long ( under-edited ) , over-indulgent failure . Glad so many of you enjoyed it !  
  This may have been made for the hell of it , but it was most probably the worst film i 've seen in years , The best thing about the entire DVD would be the case ! I 'm surprised that people took the time to make something so rubbish and yet spend money on it too , I 'm glad i only rented . I suppose the real fans of this film would probably have to be sadistic and Gothic to care about it without taking in any CGI or any other effects for that matter , I hope Alex Chandon learnt a lesson about lighting and SFX to make a better film in the future , that is , if he is still in work . Notes to buyers this is extremely disappointing , DON'T BUY IT !  
  This film is a very funny film . The violence is bad , the acting is .. Well Dani , stick to singing or screaming or whatever the hell it is you usually do . The random chicks wearing hardly anything is just to catch sexually-frustrated goth lads in . Personally , i think this movie really does suck . The story and characters COULD be very good , if say the directing , the actors and other little nibby things were made better . But the film is just bad , the only reason why people like this piece of crap is because it has Danni in it . This film is possibly the worst B-rate film ever . And , believe me that 's hard to achieve , especially when you 're competing with Def by Temptation and over crappy excuses for " serious " horror movies . I 'm not a CoF fan , and so i just see this as another rubbish movie .. A really bad one . If Dani made this as a comedy then , good going him . Very well done . Over than that though , i rate it low , for it 's crappiness . Watch it when you 're in a happy , happy , joy , joy mode so you can laugh at everything or if you 're high on multiple different types of drugs .  
  Saw this ' film ' recently and have to say it was the worst attempt at film making I have ever had the misfortune to see . What the Hell was going on with Coolio ? Totally unprovoked shooting at people in distress . Totally uninvolving , slow , tedious and detached . Worse than Spawn . long live " Evil dead II " .  
  I was expecting a movie similar to Deuce Bigalow , which I enjoyed . However , this dud seemed to last forever . It 's one of those flicks which enjoys the sad placement of PG-13 while not being kid appropriate . The jokes aren't just low-brow or f * t jokes , they 're crude , lewd , and many acts cross the boundaries to not only bad taste but beyond legal and moral decency . Many scenes appear to have been chopped to get the PG-13 rating .. too bad .. it might have made a bigger splash as an R-rated film if the funny was left in . ( Overstatement ? Probably . ) I do not recommend this movie . It is a full-on waste of time .. and I 'm a movie lover and ready to give just about anything a shot . At 45 minutes in , the movie felt like it should be winding down .. and boy were we ready for it to . The ending is quaint but doesn't salvage the rest of this quagmire / tourist trap of a rental . 1/2 star ( glad I saw it as a freebie .. would have been sickened to pay hard-earned greenbacks for this tripe )  
  Dreary . Schlocky . Just plain dreadful and awful . Let 's be honest , when you sit down to watch something called The Double-D Avenger you aren't expecting great art or even mild mainstream entertainment . You are probably expecting a cult film type and maybe get some good looks at some impressive busts . You don't get really either of these in the video . The story , as it consistent with most of these types , is inane : Kitten Natividad runs a local pub , finds out she has breast cancer , flies down to South America for a fruit that claims to be a panacea for any ills and a super-human abilities giver , returns and fights , dressed as the Double-D Avenger , a group from a local strip club wanting to edge out the competition . As stories go , I have seen a lot worse , but as another reviewer noted the execution is horrendous . The action sequences lack zip , drive , motivation , and are tissue thin . The acting isn't even properly campy and the dialog is the pits . Nothing , and I mean NOTHING is funny from the wincing puns to the heavy-handed boob references . All could be forgiven if the girls could make up for it , but they all fall way short . Kitten , Haji , and Raven de la Croix are all quite older ( still lovely in their own ways ) yet expose nothing and become the antithesis of what they are trying to be : older , campy caricatures of their former selves . Instead , they look so lame and desperate - more because of the vehicle they are " starring " in rather than their own abilities . There are some other lovely ladies , but you really do not see much of anything . PG - 13 definitely could be an appropriate rating for this . The material , the actresses , and director are all tired , tiresome , and dated - and again - NOT FUNNY ! It was a brutal hour plus sitting through this , and that is a shame as I was expecting something campy and fun . The guy playing Bubba by the way was the only real laugh for me . Not that he was good at all mind you , but every time he opened his mouth I kept thinking how truly awful he was . The lone bright spot here at all is seeing Mr . Sci-fi himself , Forrest J . Ackerman , play the curator of a wax museum and chatting to his wax Frankenstein affectionately called Frankie . Other than that this is a complete bust - now how is that for another tired , dreadful , trite pun !  
  Hard to describe this one - if you were a fan of Russ Meyer films back in the day , you will surely be pleased to see that Haji is still looking really hot , though Forry Ackerman has not fared so well ( what is he doing still making these movies anyway ? If I go up to him with a camera will he be in my movie ? ) . It was a pretty fun premise - a superhero whose giant mammaries are her secret weapon - but sometimes it did not pan out for the whole length , and the jokes were on a level with your average Joe E . Brown comedy ( or , Abbott and Costello if that 's your thing ) - basically just bad puns . Still , I found this movie fascinating to watch , and for more than 2 reasons . Good job , but still a fundamentally flimsy production .  
  Proof why Hollywood conventions are in place . Stale dialogue , underdeveloped and flat characters and a disjointed storyline are only part of the problems with this gangster classic wannabe . An attempt to be daring and different but this appears to be a slap-together attempt at recreating the magic of Arthur Penn ' s Bonnie and Clyde ( 1967 ) and George Roy Hill ' s Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid ( 1969 ) - truly innovative filmmakers and films - but falling well below the bar . Problems with storylines being self-explanatory result in the need for a voiceover to explain problem sections . The editing appears again to be an attempt to duplicate the previous classics but is occasionally disjointed and cause more problems for me technically . Unnecessary shots are thrown in to justify the filming of them but would have better served the viewer by sitting on the cutting room floor . Stills , black & white montages and period music are thrown in from time to time in attempts to either be different or to cover up for scenes that can't transition well or to replace scenes that just didn't work at all and again are reminiscent of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid ( 1969 ) . Overly dramatic pauses between sentences , random shots of surrounding scenery that wasn't needed for storytelling plus over-the-top acting of bit players and supporting actors was reminiscent of the backyard camcorder directors of the late 1980 's - I was left wondering who was in charge of this film during production and during post-production . The playing of music in most two shots and close-ups and then suddenly stopping in wide shots overly emphasized a weak musical score . No sound editing was drastically apparent as the bulk of the film was gunshots , doors , footsteps and dialogue ( a style used in the late 60 's through the mid-70 's by new directors ) but lacking background noise causing it to seem artificial - particularly the tire squeaks on dirt roads . In my honest opinion the biggest problem of all is there are no ' likeable ' characters for the audience to route for nor were we lead to see as the protagonists of the story . Neither the gangsters nor the lawmen were characters I wanted to see win and neither were focused on as the ' hero '- a necessity for any story to work for me . We know from Penn 's and Hill 's movies who the ' heroes ' are . Even though they are criminals , we like them and want to see them get away . I could care less who was on the screen in this film . I got the impression that John Milius was trying to give off a non-historically accurate reenactment documentary of the events surrounding John Dillenger 's life from June 1933 to July 1934 ( his death ) . To be fair , there are some moments of good solid storytelling , which are moments that shine forth brightly from the dark and dismal canister in which this film sits . John Milius gets better thankfully in future films where he doesn't seem to try to ' copy ' other filmmakers . Dillinger ( 1973 ) isn't a total waste as many stars and famous faces who were at the cusp of breaking out are involved with this directorial ' big budget ' debut , but wait for it on a classic movie channel rather than spending money to rent or buy .  
  I love the episode where Jim becomes the Greenman . It is great ! When Jim tosses that little person through the window , the look on his face is priceless . Then when he starts to address the Priest in his wife 's behalf only to find out that she has become the Pee-Woman ? Great writing and great casting along with great acting makes this a must see . I am attempting to find a certain photo from that episode . I 'd like to use it as my avatar on a message board because I think the Greenman is hilarious . Does anyone know where I can download a photo of Jim as the Greenman ? Can anyone point me in the right direction to find such a photo ?  
  I really felt cheated after seeing this picture . It felt like I sat watching this movie 101 minutes for nothing . I don't understand what they were thinking when they made this . It hardly gets into Jeffrey Dahmer murdering and it has no ending . It felt almost like they were leaving this movie open for a sequel . It was like watching a television episode of the Sopranos . It ends suddenly , and you know there 's going to be another episode next week . It also felt like I just watched part 1 to a two part movie . There are many possibilities for what went wrong here ; they got lazy , they ran out of money , they didn't know the rest of the story , they wanted to make a Dahmer 2 . After seeing this movie they all sound very accurate . I was watching Jeffrey Dahmer walking through the woods . All of a sudden I hear this music playing , then writing comes on the screen and says how Dahmer served 2 years of his sentence and was attacked by a fellow inmate and killed at the age of 34 . Wow , he goes from a walk in the woods to his death in jail . How about showing how he got there . How about showing Dahmer 's trial . How about showing some more detail . I can't even explain what happened in this movie because it jumped all over the place . I actually found myself saying in disbelief , " That 's it , that 's the end ? " I want to conclude this review by saying there is still a good Dahmer movie yet to be made . To the filmmakers I 'd like to say , if you 're going to do it , do it right .  
  I generally don't give worry much about violence in films , or a vast amount of philosophy , symbolism or psychology . All this is very well with me and the film brings a lot of the above to us . There is beautiful pictures especially of the lake and the nature , a good setting of characters , a good direction . This film could be voted for as a good film . However , it is spoiled for two reasons and both of these reasons in relation make this film simply disgusting . First of all there is violence used against living creatures to make this film . Not movie violence , I am talking about REAL violence . This violence alone maybe could be justified if not and thats reason number two ; the message of the film was not mere introspection about the directors twisted relation towards women . Not that we all don't have some real twists with women . ( respectively men ) . But the conclusion of the film ruins it all . * spoiler * Our " heroine " finally dies , ( by here own hand if I remember correctly I saw this film years ago and it enraged me , now the guy is out with a new film witch I am certainly not going to watch ) and is now even more clearly depicted as some kind of natural demon , nature growing over her , in particular her sex .. Of course it is the director who " kills " the women heroine . Women have to die , especially if men are attracted by their sexuality . That seems to be the final conclusion . * end spoiler * Well , well all that possibly would be fine with me if the director would have kept his view to himself . But to use big pictures , artsy directions cruelty to living creatures , just to say men can be frightened of women , and men are cruel to women . Thats just not enough . I knew when I saw this film it would achieve good critics for the " philosophical , eastern and artistic " and whatever approach . But to me this film is just totally marred .  
  " Nacho Libre " ( 2006 ) Directed By : Jared Hess Starring : Jack Black , Ana de la Reguera , Héctor Jiménez , & Darius Rose MPAA Rating : " PG-13 " ( for some rough action , and crude humor including dialog ) Say what you will about it ( I know some people who despise it to no end ) , but I have always thought that " Napoleon Dynamite " was a funny movie-not the brightest brick on the wall , but a funny movie , nonetheless . Jack Black is also a very funny man-irritating at times , yes , and massively overrated by adolescent audiences who practically worship him , but funny . There has rarely been a Jack Black comedy that I did not enjoy to some degree . So , I was very happy to hear that Jared Hess , the writer and director of " Napoleon Dynamite " , and Jack Black would be teaming up for a movie about a Spanish friar who becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage . My only reservation was that the plot seemed a little too thin . Unfortunately , my one reservation turned out to be downfall of the entire movie . This plot , had it been done as a skit on some such show as " Saturday Night Live " or possibly even " Mad TV " , would have worked flawlessly . Unfortunately , the plot runs far too thin over the approximate one and a half hour runtime and this one-joke comedy falls flat . Nacho was raised in a Mexican monastery and became a devout man of the Lord . Feeling shunned by the entire monastery , Nacho ( Black ) , now the monastery 's cook , decides to follow his dreams to become a professional wrestler . As the monastery 's finances hit an all-time low , Nacho decides to join a wresting tournament so that he can win the prize money and provide good food for the monastery 's orphanage . This plot sounds so sweet and caring . It seems like the perfect movie for Jack Black . Look what he did with " School of Rock " after all . Well , to my displeasure , this plot is almost completely ruined by offensive and gross humor that just takes away from the heart of the movie . It is again Hollywood 's way of showing that they feel that teen audiences will only understand fart jokes and stupid humorof course , for all I know , maybe that is the general thought of teenagers , as many seemed to enjoy this movie . Watching an obese woman scurry like a mouse across the floor will certainly make people laugh , but don't expect to get an award for putting it in your movie . A seven-year-old could make up the same joke . The performances in " Nacho Libre " are actually good . Jack Black proves once again that he is absolutely hilarious and that he can make even the most idiotic , worthless lines in ever put on paper comical . Unfortunately , this movie just wasn't enough for him . It didn't give him anything to go on and the only reason any of his jokes worked was because of him . I had never seen or heard of Ana de la Reguera before , but now I can say that , not only is she quite talented , but she is also one of the most beautiful women to have ever graced my eyesight . She just clicked in the role and it worked wonderfully well . Héctor Jiménez , who plays Nacho 's bumbling partner , Esqueleto , kept me laughing continuously . He did a very nice job and it was very effective when partnered with that of Jack Black 's . Darius Rose , who plays an orphan named Chancho , didn't have many lines , but , what can I say , I just enjoyed him . He was adorable . The rest of the cast did their job . It is unfortunate that they were wasted on such a sub-par movie . " Nacho Libre " just does not work . Its plot is stretched far too thin . The heart of it all is soiled by moronic humor and sickening jokes that just don't work . I very rarely laughed and , if I did , it was because of Jack Black or another member of the cast . And that leads me to the bright side of " Nacho Libre " : yes , the cast . This cast was justwell , for lack of a better word , they were on . They all clicked , had excellent chemistry together , and pumped as much life as possible into the flat script . After Jared Hess 's " Napoleon Dynamite " kept me thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the movie , I was surprised to find myself so often bored with " Nacho Libre " . Something was lost here and I have yet to understand what it was . All I know is that " Nacho Libre " is not a good movie and yet , because of its cast , it is completely worthless . There is a small reason to watch , if only to watch Jack Black work . But , if you are not a fan of Jack Black , then avoid this movie like the plague . I like Black , but I am done with this movie and with this review . Final Thought : Yikes ! This is Jared Hess 's surprisingly disappointing follow-up to his hysterical " Napoleon Dynamite " . Overall Rating : 4/10 ( C + )  
  In what seemed like the longest 1hour 35 I 've had to endure in a long time , Al Pacino delivers an accurate performace to be sure . Not his usual typecasting , which was nice . But his character was just truely pathetic . Someone to pitty as he stumbles around forgetting appointments as we realise that the Hollywood social life has drained him of his life energy . But in this movie we needed someone to like . And for some reason , every character in the picture said " I don't know why I like you , Eli " to Al Pacino 's chracter and I couldn't even come close to liking him . All the other actors played their usual styles . Tea Leoni , Richard Schiff , and Bill Nunn did nothing to change their established personas developed on TV or in earlier films . And Kim Basinger wasn't even in the film long enough to deliver a performance of any kind . The movie 's story had no momentum . Most scenes never driving the story forward , but rather just collecting factoids about characters which later came into play in an anti-climactic ending . It had potential except for their unwillingness to build upon the story . Whats the point of the film ? Daniel Algrant and Jon Robin Baitz would have you believe " Once Hollywood has you , you can't get out . " Yeah right ! And that 's why so many people get fired in Hollywood .  
  Yes , MTV there really is a way to market Daria . What started as a clever teenage angst - " comment on everything that sucks and make the viewer feel better about their sucky teenage life " sitcom now mutated into a " how you should deal with your problems " - charade . I used to watch Daria all the time and loved it . Now , sitting here after watching the so called " movie " I can only wonder what the point of this all was . Daria tells us how to lead out life in college ? Excuse me ? didn't the point Daria made every episode that what you like to do is ok , as long as it is ok with yourself no matter what the rest of the sick sad world thinks of it ? This entire thing reminded me of the scene in " Reality Bites " the movie channel shows the documentry for the first time .  
  What was the worst movie of 2003 ? " Cat in the Hat ? " " Gigli ? " Mais non ! I propose that it was this atrocious little film from earlier in the year . Badly written , badly edited , and ( if I may be so bold ) badly acted , " The Order " is the black hole of film - a movie so dense not even the slightest bit of entertainment could escape from its event horizon of suck . It isn't even accidentally funny , like ( for example ) " Showgirls . " You know that the producers are assuming that their audience isn't going to be very smart . They renamed the movie , originally titled " The Sin Eaters , " because they figured Americans were too stupid to understand what a sin eater was , even though they go to great lengths to explain what a sin eater is in the movie . Instead , they figure an utterly generic title and a picture of Heath Ledger looking sullen are more than enough to get you in there . And , hey , what do you know , they were right ! My ex-girlfriend saw the picture of Heath and dragged me in . Congratulations , producers , you 've met your target market . She also liked " Grease II , " so you 're in good company . Back on topic , Heath plays a Catholic monk from a specific ( you guessed it ) order that is trying to investigate the murder of his mentor . He has celibacy issues , possibly because nobody in their right mind would believe that he knew the slightest thing about religion , much less be a celibate monk . The only other member of this order is a funny alcoholic fat guy . As much as I 've wanted to see the return of the funny alcoholic to the big screen , his attempts at humor reminded me of all the dorks in my high school who did imitations of Monty Python , thinking that if they just said the lines like the Pythons did they would automatically be funny . You know the sort of people I 'm talking about . If I utter any more , I would be in danger of generating spoilers . Frankly , the thing that spoiled this movie for me was the fact that it was created .  
  The good fellas at Webster 's Dictionary define Logophobia as the fear of words ' . I may just be Logophobic . For no word combination scares me more than when at the beginning of a film , credits contain the words ` Produced , Written and Directed by : ' , and are followed by a single individual 's name . Think about it . There are carpenters , electricians and plumbers , but so few jack of all trades . Even the most seasoned of directors like Speilberg and Scorsese rarely take such control of their films . But there I was , all nestled in my theatre seat , popcorn in hand and about to watch The Order when hurled at me like a Nolan Ryan fastball , were the words ` Produced , Written and Directed by Brian Helgeland ' . Whoa ! Being a film buff , I knew of Brian Helgeland . As a writer his filmograpghy over the past 10 years would be graphed like a dotcom company 's stock price in 1998 . There were as many theatrical unpleasantries ( Assassins , The Postman , Conspiracy Theory ) as there were critical and award winning successes ( L.A. Confidential , Mystic River ) . They seemed to alternate  one good , one bad , so knowing that his last film , BloodWork was one of the most wasted efforts in Clint Eastwood 's career , I took a breath and hoped for the best . In retrospect , I should not have exhaled . The Order stars Heath Ledger ( Helgeland 's A Knights Tale ) , as Alex Bernier , a priest in an order known as the Carolingians , who is summoned to Rome when a fellow priest is killed under circumstances that the Arch Bishop deems curious ' . Meeting up with Father Thomas ( also of the Order and played wonderfully by Still Standings ' Mark Addy ) , they set out to piece together the riddle left behind in the wake of the priest 's untimely death . Complicating matters is a sub plot involving Mara Sinclair ( played by Shannyn Sossamon ) who has escaped from an institution that was the result of her attempts to kill Alex during an exorcism . Alex has feelings towards Mara and for some reason unbeknownst to the audience , they travel to Rome together . Nary a good nights sleep goes by and Alex is confronted by William Eden ( Benno Fürmann ) who claims to be a centuries old Sin Eater . A Sin Eater , as we are told , are those that eat the sins of a dying individual when the church does not , thus allowing entrance into Heaven . William , as luck would have it , is tired of a life of healing and looks for Alex to take over his role and free him from his worldly duties . Alex is reluctant , but after the death of his new love Mara , Alex resorts to the ritual of the Sin Eater to save her and the transformation is complete . Alex then searches for answers to his many queries while Father Thomas unveils the Vatican plot behind the passing of authority to his fellow investigator . The Order is not a terrible film , but it is terribly boring . There were ridiculous special effects and no connection with any of the characters . Even in the most dramatic scene - that of Alex walking in on the dying Mara - is pale and bland and leaves us with no emotional response towards the couple 's plight . Everybody seems to talk so quietly and unemotionally that the film flat lines and smelling salts could have been administered to keep me from trying to grab a quick nap in the middle of the film . So , Mr . Helgeland , I plead with you not to try this again . Share your vision with others and allow those more experienced to help direct you in directions that are not so narrow minded and self-serving . Until then , there is nothing emanating that shows you are capable of anything more than a failing grade . Two stars .  
  I read John Everingham 's story years ago in Reader 's Digest , and I remember thinking what a great movie it would make . And it probably would have been had Michael Landon never got his hands on it . As far as I 'm concerned , Landon was one of the worst actors on earth , and his artistic license went way over the top , similar to his massacre of the " Little House " book series is proof . The acting , for lack of a better word , is atrocious , the screenplay sloppy , and there are more close-ups of Landon 's puss than should be allowed . This movie reflects Everingham 's story as much as " Little House On The Prairie " reflects the books is was " based " on . It 's just another vehicle to show off Landons horrendous hair .  
  Unashamedly ambitious sci-fi from Kerry Conran , for whom this is clearly a labour of love . Unfortunately it 's just not that good . It all starts well enough - with an epic but restrained score , a mixture of Lucas and Hitchcock style editing and the glossy cinematography of a Spielberg . The movie also references many pulp sci-fi novels , serials and films as diverse as The Day The Earth Stood Still , Superman , Metropolis , Planet Of The Apes , The Iron Giant , Star Wars and The Spy Who Loved Me . The film however , fails to be as good as any one of those for several reasons : the main being that it 's such a labour of love , so concerned with throwing everything at the screen and creating a brave new world , Conran actually forgets about making a movie . There is little to no tension , atmosphere or magic on offer here despite aerial battles , dinosaurs and race-against-time set-pieces . Even the noir elements fall flat . This is a broad way of looking at things though - those elements mainly fail because nothing feels at all real and is so obviously fake - the green-screen just looks like a video game half the time and it 's obvious the actors have been pasted on afterwards . The actors don't get to do much either - Jude Law is wooden , Gwyneth Paltrow is annoying and stupid , Angelina Jolie is wasted - and it 's all because of an awful script - the sort that has to explain nearly everything . It is a decent experience and some might get a nostalgia feel but ultimately this is a pointless step into the world of yesterday . Nice ending though .  
  Get your brewskies out and enjoy this flawed action flick . Speakman 's considerable kempo skill ( nice spin kicks , decent with the sticks - poor couch ! ) is the only redeeming quality of a movie that just cries bad acting . The plot isn't half bad ; just executed pretty poorly . But if you 're seeing this movie for anything other than martial arts , you 're missing the boat entirely . And for a movie that is supposed to take place in Koreatown , way way too few Korean actors ( even extras ) .  
  Knights was just a beginning of a series , a pilot , one might say . The plot ( I really shouldn't call it that , there wasn't any plot ) wasn't logical at all and there were many mistakes , like [ warning , I 'm summarizing the plot ] : In the beginning of the movie someone said that there was only a couple of those cyborgs ( the bad guys ) but after the climax , Nea found out that there were many many more left of them . And it was told that cyborgs were hard to kill , but after a month 's training , Nea could kill them with a single blow . The movie was just pure kicking . I wasn't surprised at all , when I found out that the leading star was a kick boxer . There was ONE positive thing in the whole movie : it really gave a great deal of laughter when watching it and talking about it with my friends . I recommend watching it , if you are in need of laughter .  
  " Nat " ( voiced by Trevor Gagnon ) , along with his brainiac friend " IQ " ( voiced by Philip Bolden ) and the always hungry " Scooter " ( David Gore ) are kids with big dreams . They want to be the first flies in space . And what encourages their dreams is the first spacecraft to land on the moon , the Apollo 11 , is waiting for its historic trip on the launch pad near where the three hang out . The first thing you notice is the animation of the film . I found it done very well done . The scenery had depth to it , as things in the distance actually looked like they were behind the focus of the scenes . I didn't see the movie in 3-D , as it was broadcast on HBO . However , I could see that there really wasn't any scenes which took advantage of the 3-D effects except a fight between characters near the end . I also wasn't really impressed with the design of the characters . To me , they didn't look like anything resembling a fly , especially in the coloring . The flies were an unusual blue-gray that was kind of distracting to me . The performances from the cast was not bad , but it wasn't good either . There were many times I focused more on my computer than the story . The writing was certainly written for a younger audience , with comedic moments that will make younger kids laugh . I saw nothing for adults , like jokes that they 'll get the punchline for the adults to understand the meaning . History was not followed in this film . In fact , I think it was completely ignored , as the main focus was the flies . I also hated when a well known astronaut popped up on the screen and explained that the stories about the flies in the film was a work of fiction , and no flies were on Apollo 11 . I did like how he thanked the men and women who sacrificed their lives for space exploration though . If you are an adult , this is not for you . It was not made for the entire family . This is certainly just for kids . But , save this one for a rainy day .  
  From around the time Europe began fighting World War II , until the war 's end , Hollywood ( with significant prodding from the government ) made tons of movies which were designed to try and get young men to enlist in the Army , by making the life of a serviceman appear " cool . " This is by far the sloppiest , implying that the life of a soldier is devoid of work , you get the best food , and you get to lie around all day listening to Ann Miller on the radio . I am far too young to have participated in WWII , but I think that there was more to it than that . There is the barest cat 's whisker of a plot , and a bunch of musical numbers featuring some of the day 's leading acts . I think that by 1943 , even the most naive of civvies knew that there was more going on overseas than the wacky hijinks portrayed in this movie . While I am sure that it was meant to be viewed as escapist entertainment , I can't help but wonder if the family and loved ones of men fighting in the war , were amused or repulsed by this trivialization of their loved ones ' sacrifice .  
  The master of cheap erotic horror , Rolfe Kanefsky , finally makes a movie that doesn't go straight to the Playboy Channel . " The Hazing " borrows heavily from everything that came before it from Nightmare on Elm Street to Evil Dead , but still manages to do it with enough humor to make it watchable .. just barely . The characters are cardboard , the dialogue is wooden , the story is paper-thin and the actors couldn't act their way out of a grocery bag . Put that all together and you have a pulpy ball of mulch for a movie . Sometimes , when I 'm bored , I like to eat paper . Watching this movie is a lot like that . Chew on it for 90 minutes and you 're left with a weird taste in your mouth and no nutritional value .  
  I saw this movie primarily to see Brooke Burke ( as Jill ) , who I had meet briefly in LA at a modeling trade show , in her first feature film . I was hoping to see more of her , but thought she did very well acting her role . Since she is such a beautiful and poised TV host , and model , it was not surprising . I was left wondering why she was killed , and what happened as a result . Maybe I just missed it . I wasn't really sure about the genre of this movie , and although I liked the actors I felt like it was for a college audience . I tried to keep an open mind considering horror wasn't my favorite genre , but felt like I had outgrown the gags . It seemed to drag out in some places , leave you guessing in some places about what powers the evil professor had , and , like a lot of other films had an unsatisfying ending . Having written a couple of scripts , I know a lot of this is difficult and may come down to personal opinions , how many movies you have seen & studied , and those you relate with at a point in time . In a nutshell , I found it interesting , but not a satisfying plot and ending for me . If Jill ( Brooke Burke ) would have returned through the portal in the end and kicked everyone 's ass that would be a satisfying ending and would earn a higher rating .  
  It 's kind of fascinating to me that so many reviewers consider this a masterpiece . I am not a dullard as far as quality films go , and I will agree that from a technical filming standpoint , as well as for several of the characters portrayed , the film is in an award-worthy class . But there is no sense ( for me ) of this film actually going anywhere ; I mean , taking the viewer anywhere . It is a series of mood scenes , perhaps remarkable as such , but I want more from a film . I look for story and movement and a fulfillment of arrival , none of which did I find in this film . Yes , it might be considered poetry on film . . . but there is much poetry that I cannot live with for the same reason : that it paints pictures without going anywhere . One thing further to be said is that it documents a mid-century English childhood , which is necessarily limited in its universality . I was personally appalled at what a young British boy had to live through , in that time and place . Having grown up in America just a decade earlier , I can authoritatively say that the contrast is immense . I cannot help wondering if this contrast has had some effect on those reviewing the film so favorably . In other words , could there be a tendency to judge the film entirely on its ' filmic magic ' ( which I acknowledge is there ) and completely ignore its lack of relevance to the nature of one 's actual recalled experience ?  
  It 's hard to imagine that anyone could find this short their favorite if they have seen most of their shorts , but I know that humor is VERY subjective . I have seen all of their sound shorts ( by far the best of their stuff IMO ) and I found this one of their weaker efforts . In the year this was made ( 1930 ) Stan and Babe made 15 shorts and one feature . They were extremely popular and their boss Hal Roach took full advantage by keeping them working constantly . In addition , this was a time of experimentation for the writers and Stan . I would say this was an experiment that really did not work . As someone else said , it does not play to their strengths . Too much dialog and plot . The best part of this one for me is the largely improvised sequence with Stan as Agnes the maid and the great Thelma Todd talking about " girl " stuff . If you really want to see the boys at their most creative and funny check out Blotto , or Brats From the same year . They made so many shorts in such a short time that I think they can be forgiven for turning out a few less then par shorts . They made something like 108 films altogether . Very few ( except for the ones made at FOX ) were outright failures but there are some . County Hospital , Me And My Pal , The Live Ghost , The Fixer Uppers come to mind as essentially weak ones . But other then those I find something wonderful in just about all their shorts . Quite a record in my book . If you have seen and enjoyed all their other shorts then by all means check this one out , but I would be willing to bet that this one was less then memorable to Stan and Babe .  
  Störtebeker is truly one of the worst TV mini-series ever made on this planet . The acting is unbearable and the historic background is mostly nonsense : Just two examples : Visby was shown as a village of three houses . Instead , it was a major city at this time , it 's best days already passed by . Secondly , Hamburg would have never been the city taking care of pirates in the Baltic Sea . Hamburg had no access to the Baltic Sea , the major town at that time was Lübeck . But worse than all that : The directing ! How can a dilettante like this guy be allowed to direct a movie like this ? Impossible ! There was not a single believable scene it , the fights were ridiculous and I could not suppress laughter at most stern scenes . I can't understand at all how a major television station could be so incompetent .  
  Quentin Crisp once stated that when things are shown too beautifully , one is a romantic . When things are show unbearably grim , they are realistic . And when something gets the ironic treatment , they 're spot on . Unfortunately for Leon de Aranoa , he falls into the second catagory . This director has obviously tried too hard to make a Spanish " Ken Loach " type movie , without being able to capture the comedy , and warmth between the characters , that elevate Loach movies from merely being ' depressing ' . Los Lunes al Sol , is just that , only depressing . Things are unrealistically grim . The characters ultimate moments of misery all reach a climax at the same point , and if the glum story isn't enough , Aranoa washes the tale over with a visually grey and grimy colour palette . The films was ridiculously over-rated at the Goyas . A movie that shows empathy for the weaker citizens in society , in this case unemployed harbour workers , does not automatically make for a good movie , even though I would be the first to sympathize with the fates of these people . This movie only manages to make me grow disinterested in their fate . In 21st century Spain , unemployed people do not live like beggars , and the public transport ferries have decent restrooms , and it 's hard to come across a bar with so few punters and such little happiness to be encountered in it . Leon de Aranoa obviously doesn't have a clue about working class Spain , and does it no favours . Pretentious is the only conclusion I can draw . The scene where the men watch a football match for free , has been directly copied from a film which deals much more ' realistically ' with the subject of the ' poverty ' trap , namely " Purely Belter , " which is afar more engaging , humorous , and yet sad .  
  AKA : Mondays In The Sun I have no idea what I just watched . Three men wander aimlessly and drink , grousing about everything and at everyone in their path . This is supposed to be a drama , but what it is , is a total waste of film , without a single redeeming quality . I have read reviews touting the performances herein as " wonderful , " " beautiful , " and " heroic . " I 'm afraid I cannot agree , unless these men were supposed to come off as the dumbest most ignorant proto-humans who ever walked . All in all ? This was not a movie . It wanders throughout and loses everyone but the audience . I 've watched this three times , and cannot for the life of me see what anyone sees in this garbage . There is nothing profound here , whatsoever . It 's crap . It rates a ZERO / 10 from .. the Fiend : .  
  For years Madonna has tried to prove not only herself , but the public eye , that she can act . Unfortunately , trying too hard while failing to shed her own persona doesn't mix well . She seems to fare better when she 's NOT the star of any movie : if you watch her in supporting performances in DESPERATELY SEEKING SUSAN ( 1985 ) or A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN ( 1992 ) , she actually comes off looking good . Since the story revolves on other actors , the weight of the expectation is taken off her shoulders by default . The trouble starts when she is asked to be the star of a movie , regardless the genre . Being the focus of a plot that needs to be told in a visual way , whether it be good , mediocre or plain awful , she has to emote in ways that are akin to an actual movie performance as opposed to a video performance . This is the crucial difference between Madonna and , let 's say , Bette Davis , or Meryl Streep . The latter two , even if the movie were to fail ( because the visual storytelling lacked some effectiveness in having us relate to it , or because the script fell short , or because the actress per se was just not at her moment ) , there would be an extra something in their performances that would elevate the movie from being a complete bomb . Both Davis and Streep have had their share : Bette , having a longer career than Streep , in such fare as BUNNY O'HARE ( 1971 ) and WICKED STEPMOTHER ( 1989 ) ; Streep in SHE-DEVIL ( 1989 ) . But at least there 's been that naturalism in the way both attacked their roles that made us forget the banality of the movie and watch the performance . Madonna , on the other hand , not being an especially gifted actress capable of really letting us in on her ability to convey a persona other than herself , fares much worse , and even in the hands of someone as Woody Allen in SHADOWS AND FOG ( 1992 ) , an inferior classic , she in her pat screen time seems stilted and a little stiff , maybe even nervous , as if she were aware of the cameras and crew and just couldn't let go . So here she tries yet once again to prove she can act in what is essentially a two-character movie . Guy Ritchie , more known for action movies filled in masculine energy , seems as adrift telling a story closer to someone of the likes of Michaelangelo Antonioni or Ingmar Bergman , who could tell a tale of two people with incredible ease . And at 89 minutes , the events which take place happen in such an unconvincing way that when the final half hour comes along and the story takes a dramatic turn , it doesn't feel sincere . From being an absolute witch with no redeeming values to suddenly being in love , this has to be the most unconvincing 180 degree turn since Fay Dunaway 's Laura suddenly discovered her passion for Tommy Lee Jones in THE EYES OF LAURA MARS ( 1978 ) . Equally unconvincing is Adriano Giannini 's nasty turn around the middle of the movie - it lacks any humor and feels genuinely psychopathic - and when he gives in to Madonna 's love , it 's too quick to be believed . Filming this in slow music and a visual montage of lovemaking and beautiful scenery doesn't enhance or add upon this " transformation " from what would have been a story of survival between to unlikeable characters to a love story where both discover each other . Trying to have an unsatisfying ending works against the movie as well - it only makes it drag , bog it down , and when Madonna has to be filmed going from hope to devastation in a tight close-up , it feels she 's trying too hard . Many an actress have done better in conveying so much doing so little . Hers is a performance more suited to acting styles of the late 20s , early 30s where posturing compensated as acting a part or an emotion . Could the movie have been better ? Of course . There are a myriad of ways to have filmed it in a way that would leave the viewer feeling that these people could at least hope to see each other again - it 's been done before , in OVERBOARD ( 1987 ) , for example . It could have had an existential undertone in which two very different people have to rely on each other but not necessarily change ( to ensure a moral tone ) . Much dialog and unnecessary erotic scenes could have been spared for a more " silent " film look - as in PERSONA ( 1966 ) . It could have even been something of a thriller , providing that the Giannini character have a mean streak as Billy Zane had in DEAD CALM ( 1989 ) . Even if it would have been done as a sex farce it would have worked better for Madonna as the over the top , uber-control freak getting her comeuppance . But with its mean streaked humor , without at least a glimpse of her character having a softer side that hides behind a mask of bitchdom , and without really defining Giannini 's own character , this becomes another misfire trying to look like a battle of the sexes .  
  First off , the title character is not even the main character of the movie . He is the sidekick of the cult leader . The actor who portrays Igor believed that screaming loud , laughing hysterically , and having a crooked smile while bugging out your eyes would be an excellent way to scare people . Igor also had the annoying habit of yelling ( because he never actually just spoke ) in a high pitched voice . He would also say idiotic one-liners . For example when the cult leader murders one of his followers with a buzz saw , Igor upon seeing this , yells out " Paul ! No Paul ! Why 'd you do it ? I could have cut her clean ! So clean ! " In another scene Igor tells a victim that she would have to ' get her own tools for surgery because right now , it was his time to operate . ' Aside from the bad acting , the ending did not make sense because while the story builds up what little steam it has towards the climax , which is Igor getting a crossbow arrow to the head and the rest of his lunatic buddies being killed , he shows up again two more times to kill the remaining ' good guys ' . The movie offers no explanation of this , only telling the viewer that Igor escaped from the mental hospital . What ? Bottom line is do not waste your time watching this movie . I wish I could get back the moments I lost watching this .  
  I was really looking forward to watching this , being that I love Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a gifted actress . The beginning was interesting . I liked the relationship between the two stars . It then quickly jumps to the main plot , which is they get attacked by a group of strangers and Dyer gets beaten extremely bad while Anderson gets raped . They then decide to go for some revenge . Sounds good , right ? Well , it 's not . The story gets boring and side-tracked , and certain things get really weird . I won't give out any details , but things happen that I , for one , have no desire to see . I like to give all movies the benefit of the doubt , and I really wanted to like this one . It just didn't work out . I give it a 3 out of 10 , mainly for the acting .  
  Alan ( Anthony Steffen ) , an English multi-millionaire with a few screws loose ( thanks to his first wife 's infidelity and untimely death during childbirth ) , entices sexy , red-headed women to his castle , offering them bundles of cash to stay the weekend . Once back at his ancestral pile , he gets them nekkid , proceeds to flog them with a bull-whip , and then kills them . But when he meets blonde hottie Gladys ( Marina Malfatti ) and falls for her ample charms , he decides to give up his murderous ways and get married . Their wedded bliss is short-lived , however , thanks to Alan 's iffy mental state , which becomes increasingly fragile when his dead wife Evelyn starts to appear outside his window and a spate of gruesome murders occur within the castle grounds . So let 's recap : a groovy 70s Euro-horror with loads of tasty women in various states of undress ; spooky Gothic retreats and misty graveyards ; a sadistic rich psycho with a penchant for drop-dead gorgeous babes with cracking bods ; several vicious murders ( including a great bit where one victim has her head bashed in with a rock and her entrails eaten by foxes ) . Normally , a checklist like that would guarantee me a good timeso why did I find ' The Night Evelyn Came Out Of Her Grave ' so dull ? Well , for starters , the plot is way too convoluted : there are red herrings , crazy plot developments , and suspects galore , and it all becomes a bit too much . By the ridiculous endingin which we discover that , all along , several people have been plotting to get their greedy paws on Alan 's wealth , and that our red-head killing nut-job is actually supposed to be the hero of the moviemy head was hurting too much to care ! Secondly , Emilio Maraglia 's direction is pretty torpid . Stylish , yes ; but as slow as molasses at times . And then there 's the bits that are just too damn silly , possibly even for a giallo : the death by poisonous snake bite ( surely one of the most bizarre choices of weapon ever ) ; Alan 's Aunt Agatha , an old crippled relative who is played by a pretty young woman ; the hiring of a group of identical curly headed blondes as maids ; the poor attempt at convincing the audience that the film is set in England ( mentioning ' pounds ' and hiring a crap police uniform for one of the extras is not enough ) ; and then , of course , there is the unlikelihood of finding a bag of sulphuric acid laying next to a swimming pool .. ' The Night Evelyn Came Out Of Her Grave ' isn't a total waste of time ( how could it be , with so much female flesh on show ? ) , but there are much better giallo 's out there . Watch this one if you 're a fan of the genre and you 've already seen the bestbut don't expect too much .  
  So far after week two of " The lone of Beauty " I am a little disappointed . Some of the acting is good , as long as we except that it is only drama . I am unsure how people can feel that this FICTIONAL DRAMA is " factual " coverage of the " Thatcher " years - it is okay as drama , but I feel the award winning book is still much better . I Wonder if the BBC will ever give us the follow up and the next part of the drama and the years that follow with " Things Can Only Get Better " finishing with 2006 and the Fact that we are still waiting ! with that promise from a Government that is full of sleaze .  
  I am glad to see most other people here don't think much of this movie , either . It has some big names in the cast , but that 's it . There is nothing else to recommend , save ogling a few pretty women which you can do in a thousand films . The story involves nothing but unlikable , self-centered , chain-smoking , " hip " characters that national film critics all seem to like .. and most of the public can't stand . The Oklahoma accents are so fake they are laughable , the southern racist stereotypes are right from Liberal Hollywood 101 and the story is depressing .  
  Decent enough with some stylish imagery however the tiny budget hampers things . I also get the impression they were trying to shock you with some of the graphic weirdo perv website stuff . if you like anime in particular stuff like cyber city and the AD police then this might up your street . but basically its low budget matrix cash in however not totally devoid of its own style . Great soundtrack by some unheard of grunge / punk / post grunge bands . Worth checking out if only for the soundtrack .  
  Dave is going through a divorce and his mind wanders back to his first love . " Wanders " is probably not the word . I should say he fixates on the past girlfriend . He recalls to the day when the relationship ended . The dream sequences only lack the hazy transitions . He fondly recalls their favorite songs and places they went . I 'm not a counselor , but maybe this had something to do with the failed marriage ? Dave goes to a support group and meets up with a lady half his age ( also divorced ) who , instead of being " turned off " by his creepiness , starts to become interested in him . Did I mention how creepy Dave is ? He sometimes refers to himself in the third person . He doesn't move his arms when he walks , either . It 's just weird . Too make a long story short , Dave plots to hunt down Mary ( the old gal friend ) and kill her .. err .. I mean confront her . He does so . Which was really creepy . He believes her to be married , yet he STILL flies half-way across the country to meet her . He stakes out her house to make sure she is alone , before he " drops in " on her . He has an awkward conversation with her that ends with his sharing the gospel of Christ in about 10 words or less , and flies back to the new young girlfriend . We enjoyed the movie mostly for unintentional comedic value . I am still entertaining the wife with my Dave impressions .. " I heard another Dave & Mary song ! "  
  I saw this movie at the Edmonton International Film Festival , with the great Dr . Uwe Boll in attendance . The film is , simply put , very , very bad . And no , not in the usual Uwe Boll " so bad it 's actually entertaining " way , but just plain bad . The plot concerns a man who leads a terrible life ( because of a past criminal record , apparently ) , can't get a job , and with an awful 900 pound cheating wife . This man turns to his cult-leader uncle in a plan to steal a truck load of toys that contain the bird flu virus . Al Qaeda also has designs on stealing the toys , and what follows is just under two hours of completely incomprehensible sex and violence . The acting is awful ( except for Dave Foley , who really tries , despite it all ) , the jokes never rise above children being shot in the chest in slow motion , and people taking a poo . It 's supposed to be satire , but I 'm not sure of what . Think " Airplane ! " , but done by the creators of South Park , and without any jokes .  
  CRIME BOSS is directed by Alberto De Martino ; an Italian crime drama partially filmed in Hamburg , Germany . An easily forgotten movie . Even in spite of a good car chase sequence , this flick seems to lumber on almost aimlessly . A new Don takes over a powerful Mafia family and finds himself fighting for his own life . Unwritten laws and ethics of the Mafia code make it hard to trust in anyone especially when millions of dollars are at stake . Brutality and violence breed the same in return . This can not be put on a shelf with the real gangster epics . Just the look of the film brings back memories of American drive-in fare . Even the popular American actor Telly Savalas can't boost the calibre of this crime drama . Antonio Sabato also stars with : Paola Tedesco , Guido Lollobrigida , Serio Tramonti and Piero Morgia .  
  This is a dumb movie . Maybe my judgment wouldn't be so harsh if the film didn't promise so much , but I just felt like this movie cheated and played me for a fool at every turn . I didn't have any beef with the acting , but I thought the characters were awful . The movie starts off with Clive Owen 's character telling us what a criminal mastermind he is , and how he planned the perfect bank robbery , something he frequently reminds us of later . Oh yeah , he also tells us he 's in a prison cell , although that turns out to be a dumb metaphor . Any idiot knows that the best bank robbery is one where a minimum number of things could potentially go wrong , and you 're long gone before the police show up . But Clive Owen 's scheme requires hanging around the bank for hours - for no reason but to stalk around and look scary as far as I can tell . He also has to control hostages , negotiate with cops , and most fantastically of all , perform a This-Old-House job on the bank 's stockroom and hide out there for a week ( I hope he brought enough food , and a bucket to pee in ) and then sneak out again . Yeah , that sure sounds like the perfect crime to me , Clive ! This plan has so many moving parts that the only reason it didn't fall apart was the screenwriter said so . And then there are the many unexplained details : Why were the cops so convinced that the crooks had accomplices among the hostages ? Who the hell is Jodie Foster 's character , and why is she so important that she has the mayor at her beck and call and she doesn't have to tell Denzel Washington her agenda because " it 's above his pay scale ? " How dumb are these cops that they can't figure out one guy speaking in a foreign language for hours is not the sound of a criminal gang planning a robbery ? How did the robbers slip away , and why did Clive Owen stick around for a week ? How did they find out about the bank chairman 's past , and the number and contents of his safe deposit box ? Why the hell would Clive Owen let in Jodie Foster or the cops ? Since when do they make toy AK-47s that look real up close ? How the hell do you bug a pizza box , anyway ? How did Clive Owen manage to sneak out of a secure area of the bank during working hours , undetected ? Did this dispassionate criminal really feel bonded enough to this cop Denzel to slip him a diamond ? None of these questions are ever answered . There are films that achieve depth by leaving you to wonder about events that happen off-screen , but I never felt that way about Inside Man . It felt like the scenes that explained these things were cut from the movie , or these questions never had any answers in the first place , and that 's weak . Particularly annoying is Jodie Foster 's character , who won't disclose what she does , but never seems to tire of reminding us how important she is . We 're just supposed to take her word for it , I guess . The only reason I gave this movie two stars is I laughed at Denzel 's " taxi cab " and " pina colada " gags , and at the kid 's outrageous video game . Other than that , this movie has no redeeming features .  
  It 's a waist to indulge such great actors in such a weak and boring movie . Besides all the unanswered questions posted in the other comments , what 's so difficult about capturing the robbers ? Just eliminate the bank workers , see who was at the bank-from all the cameras ' footage angles-prior to the robbers entry and you have those extra 4 remaining robbers among the hostages . Where is the suspense every body is talking about ? It was so obvious the moment the hostages were asked to change into this identical uniform that they were all going to walk out the front door .. seen it many times . At least Mr . Spike Lee could have seasoned the movie with some good music score and artistic shooting . The Movie is not worth it . Pronto !  
  This movie was absolutely terrible . I can't believe I paid to see it in the theatre . I wouldn't watch it on free cable t . v . I 'm surprised that Joe Magtena even made it . Do not waste your time with this movie .  
  STAR RATING : * Saturday Night * Friday Night * Friday Morning * Sunday Night * Monday Morning James Dial ( Wesley Snipes ) is hiding out on his ranch in Montana after failing to capture a notorious terrorist . Then he 's approached by the agency again to travel to London to have another go . His target has been apprehended there and is under heavy police protection - but they don't want him merely to capture their man - they want him taken out . All goes well but then the mission gets botched and when a senior police chief , Windsor ( Charles Dance ) is killed , the blame falls at Dial 's feet . Hunted like an animal , he takes refuge in a nearby house and befriends a young girl named Emily ( Eliza Bennett ) who 's dealing with issues of her own and becomes his unwitting sidekick as he goes about clearing his name and working out who betrayed him . This latest Snipes straight to DVD escapade came out of nowhere , with a minimal of publicity even for something so small time ( I don't recall seeing any advertisements or trailers for it anywhere . ) With this in mind and after Snipes 's history of duff DVD efforts , this might have seemed like one which Snoop Dawg would tell you to drop like it 's hot . But I felt compelled to give it a go anyway . It doesn't rank among his worst , but it doesn't reach any higher than the standards of some of his better ones ( The Detonator , 7 Seconds , says it all , really ) , either . This is , at best , mildly suspenseful , with a minimal of action , naff all in the way of cool dialogue and Snipes not exactly at his best in the lead role . Likewise , in a main supporting role , it 's quite clear Dance has only showed up for the pay cheque as well and this is generally one that none of the cast are going to shout for the hills about on any of their CVs . It says a lot that by the end the only ' contract ' that 's keeping you interested is when Snipes 's will end with Sony and with it an end to any further sub par EL DVD action films . *  
  As far as I am concerned this silent version of The Merry Widow is the worst version ever made . There is no tenderness or love or spirituality about this version , it is all macabre , Germanic , sinister nonsense . It reminded me of Nazis falling in love ; who cares ? This silent version by von Stroheim is not a faithful adaptation of the original story . In this one we have leering John Gilbert and his gross relative the Prince lusting after this silly American actress , played by Mae Murray , possessed with a modern permed hairstyle and implausible feminist manner that threw me off again and again . I like my romances light and beautiful , with slow build ups ; not harsh and sadistic like this one . And come on , those bee stung lips , get rid of them , girl ! Go see a live performance of the show if you would like to get a real idea of the sweetness of the original operetta by Franz Lehar . Failing that , wait till TCM shows the Jeanette MacDonald - Maurice Chevalier sound version . It 's much better .  
  his costume drama is ill cast and without charm . George Sanders was a superb character actor . But he is thoroughly implausible here as the lead , an Eighteenth Century rogue known for his philosophy and great good looks . His costar is , of all people , Akim Tamiroff . Some Frenchman ! Then there 's Signe Hasso , in a dark wig , as the virginal daughter of a wealthy family . Carole Landis fares best . The movie opens with her in silhouette . She is a soubrette , and a naughty girl at that . She disappears for a while but turns up in an improbably situation . But she 's good . She was always an appealing actress . Here she is cast closest to her usual type of role . It 's meant to be a little naughty , kind of ooh-la-la . It ought to have had a light touch but it 's a leaden affair from start to finish .  
  Can anybody do good CGI films besides Pixar ? I mean really , animation looked antiquated by 2006 standards and even by 1995 Toy Story standards . Or maybe they spent all their budget on Hugh Jackman . Whatever their reasoning , the story truly did suck . Somehow , Hugh Jackman is a rat - a rat that is flushed down a toilet . Yeah I know , seems stereotypical . But then the sewer mimicked the ways of London - to an extent . Throw in a promise of jewels ( ? ) and an evil ( ? ) frog and you get a pathetic attempt at entertainment . I would like to say something entertained me . Maybe the hookup in the movie ? Or maybe the happily-ever-after rat relationship . But nothing did . It had the talent , but it blew up . D-  
  What is supposed to be a simple generic mystery plot involving a dead philanthropist is , in fact , a head-ache inducing tale about a bunch of characters ( the only big actor being Ginger Rogers , in a very early role ) all trying to find the murderer among a small cast of residents in a posh apartment building . These characters range from utterly stupid to downright mean . As a cheap , low budget production , most of the action revolves around Rogers and her lead man ( some guy , I don't care who he is ' cause he really sucked ) talking about their various possibilities of solving the crime , while being constantly cut off by an absurd detective with his head in his butt . Honestly , I 've never had a worse time watching an old b-rate movie of this type , and I 've seen some real head-slappers . Oh , and the butler didn't do it , because there wasn't a butler . But pay attention to the guy who 's closest to a butler . There ya go . - PolarisDiB  
  The only way this is a family drama is if parents explain everything wrong with its message . SPOILER : they feed a deer for a year and then kill it for eating their food after killing its mother and at first pontificating about taking responsibility for their actions . They blame bears and deer for " misbehaving " by eating while they take no responsibility to use adequate locks and fences or even learn to shoot instead of twice maiming animals and letting them linger .  
  My wife and I rented this movie because some people had drawn parallels between it and " Office Space " . Blockbuster and IMDB even had it as an " also recommended " selection if you liked " Office Space " . Now , I 've seen Office Space probably 15 or 20 times . I love it . It 's probably one of my 10 favorite movies . Witty , humorous , and featuring characters that remind me of people I 've worked with over the years . " Haiku Tunnel " is similar to " office Space " in that they are both films . That 's where the similarity ends . We sat through probably the first 50 minutes of HT , giving it the benefit of the doubt , hoping , nay , * praying * that it would get better . It didn't . We couldn't take it any more , and stopped the tape . Thank GOD it was a free rental . I 'd have been p * ed if we 'd actually paid for it . We should be reimbursed for having to sit through it . Now , since we didn't see the end , perhaps it miraculously comes together and redeems itself . I doubt it . Haiku Tunnel is so bad it 's hard to believe it ever got produced . The movie is SO unfunny it 's painful . Just mail the friggin letters already ! The premise is asinine . The jokes are awful . We got as far as the " printer doesn't work " scene and had to stop . We couldn't take it anymore . This film is an EMBARRASMENT for Josh Kornbluth . If you are a fan of Office Space .. don't waste your time with this turd . 0/10  
  The worlds largest inside joke . The world 's largest , most exclusive inside joke . Emulating the brash and ' everyman ' humor of office space , this film drives the appeal of this film into the ground by making the humor such that it would only be properly appreciated by legal secretaries writing books . The audience is asked to assume the unfamiliar role of a legal secretary , and then empathize with the excruciatingly dumb protagonist . The entire film is centered on the legal secretary finding free time , listening to music and writing a novel while working . These are his goals . You can't imagine the slap in the face it is to the audience when ( around halfway through ) they find out he has had a job which fit all three of those criteria , but then gives it UP ! The director and screenwriter ( Jacob Kornbluth and Josh Kornbluth ) completely remove the audience 's motivation to empathize or even find entertaining a protagonist that has previously thrown away that which he is complaining about the lack thereof . Apart from that major stumbling block , the legal secretary insider humor fails because they must be explained explicitly to the audience each time they happen . Without these asides , the audience wouldn't have noticed anything particularly strange . Humor is only effective if it doesn't need to be thoroughly explained to the audience what is funny .  
  The hysterical thing about this movie is that , according to the director , it has difficulty finding a distributor in the U.S. because most of them that viewed it couldn't reconcile the seemingly conflicting messages of Christianity and American angst . The thought of anyone seeing this as a religious film in anyway is laughable . Because a minister at a mission prays with the homeless or wishes someone " Godspeed " this makes it a " Christian " movie ? One could interpret that it is actually mocking religion for in the " Land of Plenty " with all of its material excess , the best an organized mission can do is hand out a bowl of soup and a bible verse . Plenty of unfortunate or downtrodden maybe ? Plenty of useless homeless missions ? How about plenty of psycho Vietnam vets ? As a pill-popping delusional survivor of agent " pink " are we to think America is a " Land of Plenty " of paranoid patriots ? Maybe we have plenty of psychiatric patients ? Certainly we don't have plenty of people concerned about Palestine politics based on the main characters phone conversation in the film . Of course if you worked in a German homeless shelter the unfortunate there would be much more concerned about peace in a distant land than their own personal survival as the world knows how Europe is the " Continent of Plenty " when it comes to sophistication . Indeed I agreed with the title in the end as the United States is the " Land of Plenty " and in this particular case it refers to the abundance of poor scripts , amateur acting and dispassionately directed films . Life is too short and one , even an American , doesn't have " plenty " of time to waste watching this piece .  
  This movie is so bad , it can only be compared to the all-time worst " comedy " : Police Academy 7 . No laughs throughout the movie . Do something worthwhile , anything really . Just don't waste your time on this garbage .  
  You know those films that have you trapped in the cinema ? You 're stuck there in the best seat in the house , centre of the row in your own special sweet spot that you swapped three times before you got just the right seat - and after about what feels like 13 hours you are still trapped there , uncomfortable and itchy , thinking " When the F * is this film ever going to END ? " ( You know the feeling - think of A.I. and The Village ) . Well , Visitor Q delivers a weird variant of that feeling . I sat there for the first 30 minutes wondering when the thing was going to f * ing start ! It is interminable ! So " Arty " it hurts . This is the first Miike Takashi film I have watched . Apparently he makes films by the dozen and , if they are all pretentious w @ nk like this , I suspect it will be the last . I 'm not against Pretentious w @ nk . David Lynch is up there amongst the top 10 directors for me but Visitor Q is cut-rate , cheap , and nasty pretentious w @ nk . As you may have worked out by now - I hated it .  
  This movie stinks . I don't think I have ever seen a movie so strung up on shock value . The plot was relatively interesting , but the dialog was super flat and the acting was bland . This could have been an a good movie . I think it just relied on it 's grotesque visuals . I can usually handle graphic scenes and human taboos , but it felt like Miike shot it for the sake of shooting it . Just one poorly executed film . There just isn't anything to be entertained by watching this film unless you are fascinated by exhausting yourself with explicit scenes of incest , pedophilia , necrophilia , rape , self milking , parental and sibling abuse , and fecal dispersement . I think I just sold the film to many of you , but I meant it when i said this stinks . He has succeeded in other films , but I think you 'd be better off watching someone pooping .  
  Although a film with Bruce Willis is always worth watching , you better skip this one . I watched this one on television , so I didn't have to plunk down cash for it . Lucky me . The plot develops slowly , very slowly . Although the first 30 minutes or so are quite believable , it gets more and more unbelievable towards the end . It is highly questionable , if a seasoned soldier like Lt . Waters would disobey direct orders . And even if he would , if the rest of his platoon would . They know he puts them in direct danger , and they know they will certainly die if they follow him , but what the heck , he is our Lt . so let 's do what he says ( despite the direct orders , remember ) . Still , there are some nice scenes in this movie . They somewhat save a village , where the total population is being massacred by the rebels . Well , they save a dozen villagers or so , the rest was already killed . The strange part of it , that they did take the trucks which the rebels left behind . They rather go on foot . Maybe because the roads are unsafe , but there was no explanation for it . Anyway . I think this was what earned the movie the one point I gave it . What made this movie an insult to the brain and hence completely unbelievable is that a group of 7 soldiers can kill of so many rebels without being hurt or killed themselves . Only near the end they loose a few comrades . And that is only because they have to fight of an army of nearly 500 or more . Can you believe that ? They fight of an army of so many , kill hundreds of them , and only loose a few of themselves . And they have rounds and round of ammo . Never run out of it . Grenades and claymore mines , an M60 machine gun and even an RPG . Where do they get this stuff . Carrying it around or what ? They even got a laptop which shows them the activity of enemy rebels . And this laptop has a battery which goes on for days . Really ? Who think up this crap . I guess if you turn off your brain completely and accept that the rebels are a bunch of idiots , you give this movie a high rating . If not , skip this one . It saves you time .  
  Six different couples . Six different love stories . Six different love angles . Eighty numbers of audience in the movie theater . Looking at the eighty different parts of the silver screen . I am sitting in somewhere between them looking at the center of the screen to find out what 's going on in the movie . All stories have got no link with each other , but somewhere down the line Nikhil Advani trying to show some relation between them . I tried to find out a few lines I could write as review but at the end of 3 hours 15 minutes found nothing to write . The movie is a poor copy of Hollywood blockbuster LOVE ACTUALLY . My suggestion . Don't watch the movie if you really want to watch a nice movie .  
  Clocking in at an interminable three hours and twenty minutes , " Salaam-e-Ishq " is a pretty but superficial comic soap opera from India that regales us with six interwoven tales of romantic love ( which is at least four tales too many in my estimation ) . Filmed like a cross between an MTV music video and a Super Bowl beer commercial , the movie is a sprawling mishmash of exotic settings , dazzling colors , sexy showgirls , high-stepping song-and-dance numbers , dream and fantasy sequences , winking character asides , corny dialogue and way over the top comical performances - all pretty much standard-issue stuff when it comes to Bollywood happenings these days . It 's an exhausting chore just trying to keep all the characters straight as they dance , prance and preen their way through the incomprehensible storyline . There 's plenty for the viewer to feast his eyes on here - not least of all all the drop dead gorgeous women - but he 'll need the patience of Job to get him all the way through it .  
  I read a couple of good reviews on this board for " Mr . Scarface " , but for anyone uninitiated in the genre of Italian gangster films like myself , the picture will probably make very little sense . Indeed , after the initial setup involving the ten million lira scam , the picture devolved into a fairly routine revenge flick with a minor twist in the identity of Rick 's ( Al Cliver ) character . The whole gang war plot got muddied up for me with the inclusion of Vinchenzo Napoli ( Vittorio Caprioli ) , but as most other viewers commented , he 's about the only one who gave this picture any life with his often ineffective attempts at violence . I found it somewhat unbelievable that Manzari 's goons who chased Tony through the streets didn't actually stroke out before Tony even laid a hand on them . For all of his buildup as the title character , Jack Palance was wasted rather unceremoniously in an anticlimactic near finale , making the U.S. working title , " Mr . Scarface " , rather moot . I 've seen enough spaghetti Westerns to know that they don't all work ; I guess in this case , my first look at a spaghetti gangster flick didn't quite make it either .  
  Reed Diamond plays a man suffering from amnesia who 's been in a mental asylum for over a decade after he was found wondering the back roads with blood on his hands . The doctors want to test out an experimental new drug that 'll return his lost memories if it works . But when the drugs give him hallucinations of a demon , he chooses to escape instead . While outside he befriends a young boy whose stepfather ( Greg Grunberg ) mistreats his mother , won't let her near the darkroom in his basement & acts suspicious in general . While the general ' mystery ' of the film is a tad easy to identify way before it 's revealed , I found Mr . Diamond 's acting to be enthralling enough to keep my attention throughout . ( In the interest of full disclosure , I 've been a huge fan of his since Homicide and his brief , but extremely pivotal , role in The Shield up through Journeyman & Dollhouse ) Not a great film nor a good one , but serviceable enough . Although I did like it better than the previous films that I 've seen from Director / writer Michael Hurst ( Room 6 , Pumkinhead 4 , Mansquito ) Eye Candy : one fleeting pair of boobs in a hallucination My Grade : C-  
  I really wish that when making a comedy , the people actually tried to make it funny . This is a film that you can sit through , but nothing is special about it . After watching it , you will say that it was alright . It was not boring to watch , but gave the audience no jokes to laugh at . Entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than an o . k . story . This movie wanted to be " Tootsie " , but instead it failed . I gave it a 1 out of 10 .  
  Although I can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film by way of it 's intrigue , I most certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of most viewers . Enormous holes in the screenplay such as the never explained " your father died today " comment by the mother made it even harder to try to make sense of these characters . This won first place at Cannes in 2001 which is a shock considering . Perhaps the French had been starved for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film . I understood the long scenes as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible but when matched with the inability to relate to the main character it went too far for me and kept me at arms distance from the story altogether . This is a film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who expects no gratification from having watched a film once it 's over . I LOVED movies such as " Trainspotting " or " Requiem for a Dream " - which were far more disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing . To watch this teachers slow and painful silence scene after scene just became so redundant that I found it tedious - and I really wanted to like this film at every turn .  
  A movie has rarely left me as cold as this one . There is not a bit of tension , not a second of fear , not a moment we jump , even a little bit . The girl is cute , yeah . That 's it . Was that worth a movie ? I knew it wasn't supposed to be a great movie , but I was at least expecting one .  
  A trio of low-life criminals , led by Matt Dillon , botches a late-night burglary . They flee but quickly cross paths with the police who just happen to be in hot pursuit of a terrorist . Of course the police mistake the burglar gang for the terrorist , the real terrorist gets away , and the burglars are forced to take refuge in a small dive of a bar , taking hostages , unaware why the police are so intent on catching them . And guess who else has picked the bar as a sanctuary for the night ? Unbelievable ? Absolutely . And it goes down hill from there . Spacey did acquire a good bit of acting talent ; Matt Dillon , Faye Dunaway , Gary Sinise , Viggo Mortensen , and M . Emmett Walsh , but they 're all wasted . Mostly because after all the characters get stuck in the bar , all they do for the remainder of the film is argue . Endlessly and aimlessly . Long before the conclusion of the film you 've stopped giving a damn about what happens to them .  
  Unfortunately there was not a 0 for a rating or else I would 've chosen it . This movie lacks the star power that the original movie had in such abundance . Carol Burnett , Albert Finney , Tim Curry , Bernadette Peters , Edward Hermann , the innocence of newcomer Aileen Quinn , and expert directing from seasoned pro John Huston ( father of actress Angelica Huston ) is what made this film so charming . Even the 1999 remake with Kathy Bates , Victor Garber , Alan Cumming , and Kristin Chenoweth had more to offer than this sorry excuse for a sequel . Before she did this movie all Ashley Johnson was known for was her role as little Chrissie Seaver on the prime time show Growing Pains . She had a few bit parts in movies but I don't know who thought she had talent enough to carry a movie on her own . And adding Joan Collins as Lady Edwina Hogbottom , ridiculous ! They couldn't get good enough actors to play the major roles like Daddy Warbucks , Miss Hannigan , and Annie but they will sign Joan Collins to play some British lady ? It doesn't surprise me that this movie was as bad as it was . The critics were right to have not agreed with this movie , even if it was only made for TV , it was a poor sequel to an otherwise lovable movie .  
  I think we all begin a lot of reviews with , " This could 've made a GREAT movie . " A demented ex-con freshly sprung , a tidy suburban family his target . Revenge , retribution , manipulation . Marty 's usual laying on of the Karo syrup . But unfortunately somewhere in Universal 's high-rise a memorandum came down : everyone ham it up . Nolte only speaks with eyebrows raised , Lange bitches her way through cigarettes , Lewis " Ohmagod 's ! " her way though her scenes , and Bobby D .. well , he 's on a whole other magic carpet . Affecting some sort of Cajun / Huckleberry Hound accent hybrid , he chomps fat cigars and cackles at random atrocities such as " Problem Child " . And I want you to imagine the accent mentioned above . Now imagine it spouting brain-clanging religious rhetoric at top volume like he swallowed six bibles , and you have De Niro 's schtick here . Most distracting of all , though , is his most OVERDONE use of the " De Niro face " he 's so lampooned for . Eyes squinting , forehead crinkled , lips curled . Crimany , Bob , you looked like Plastic Man . The story apparently began off-screen 14 years earlier , when Nolte was unable to spare De Niro time in the bighouse for various assaults . Upon release , he feels Nolte 's misrep of him back then warrants the terrorizing of he and his kin . And we 're supposed to give De Niro 's character a slight pass because Nolte withheld information that might 've shortened his sentence . De Niro being one of these criminals who , despite being guilty of unspeakable acts , feels his lack of freedom justifies continuing such acts on the outside . Mmm-kay . He goes after Notle 's near-mistress ( in a scene some may want to turn away from ) , his wife , his daughter , the family dog , ya know . Which is one of the shortcomings of Wesley Strick 's screenplay : utter predictability . As each of De Niro 's harassments becomes more gruesome , you can pretty much call the rest of the action before it happens . Strick isn't to be totally discredited , as he manages a few compelling dialogue-driven moments ( De Niro and Lewis ' seedy exchange in an empty theater is the film 's best scene ) , but mostly it 's all over-cranked . Scorsese 's cartoonish photographic approach comes off as forced , not to mention the HORRIBLY outdated re-worked Bernard Hermann score ( I kept waiting for the Wolf Man to show up with a genetically enlarged tarantula ) . Thus we arrive at the comedic portion of the flick . Unintentionally comedic , that is . You know those scenes where something graphically horrific is happening , but you can't help but snicker out of sight of others ? You 'll do it here . Nolte and Lange squawking about infidelity , De Niro 's thumb-flirting , he cross-dressing , and a kitchen slip on a certain substance that has to be seen to believed . And Bob 's infernal , incessant , CONSTANT , mind-damaging , no-end-in sight blowhard ramblings of all the " philosophy " he disovered in prison . I wanted him killed to shut him up more than to save this annoying family . I always hate to borrow thoughts from other reviewers , but here it 's necessary . This really * is * Scorsese 's version of Freddy Krueger . The manner in which De Niro relishes , speaks , stalks , withstands pain , right down to his one-liners , is vintage Freddy . Upon being scalded by a pot of thrown water : " You trying ' to offer sumpin ' hot ? " Please . And that 's just one example . Unless you were a fan of the original 1962 flick and want a thrill out of seeing Balsam , Peck , and Mitchum nearly 30 years later ( or want a serious head-shaking film experience ) , avoid a trip to the Cape .  
  With the exception of the sound none of the above are really criticisms for this type of no budget , ( truly ) independent horror film . Make up effects and gore are very good and the lead actor was effective , the lead actress although attractive needs some coaching as she was particularly poor . The major problem with Frightworld is it 's length , at 108 minutes its half an hour too long to be effective as a slasher movie , plot wise only about ten minute of the first fifty are relevant . In places it is visually engaging and sometimes the lack of lighting works in the films favour . However when this is combined with the poor sound as is the case with most of the film large sections are difficult to watch . This could certainly be an entertaining if unoriginal " serial killer back from the dead " movie with some judicious and ruthless editing , in its current form it plays like an unfinished rough cut .  
  Barbara Streisand directs and stars in this very Jewish story . To have a chance at obtaining an education , Babs enthusiastically disguises herself as a boy which isn't the most difficult thing to do since she already looks like a boy , anyway . At her new school she meets many male classmates who have no trouble at all in believing she 's a guy . Don't miss the best of many moments of unintentional humor when Babs ' male friend thinks she 's a man , but pins ' him ' to the ground , sits on top of ' him ' , and looks affectionately into ' his ' eyes .. * snicker * . Mediocre film ; splashy story about nothing particularly interesting .  
  This is one of the few episodes ( if not the only one ) with an indisputable error in its storytelling . While handling the Ralphie situation Christopher states that he has heard about Pie-O-My 's death in the fire accident . This is an important detail because in this context it is quite obvious that Christopher knows from the beginning that Tony is the one who must have killed Ralphie . There is however no way Chris could have heard about the accident . Who should have told him and when ? By the time he is torn out of his delirium by Tony 's call nobody else was informed . Tony knows that - which makes it even worse ! Hearing Christopher talk about Pie - O-My 's death could therefore only lead Tony to the conclusion that Chris himself has set the fire . Given the impressively elaborate writing process as told by the writers themselves on the DVD I really wonder none of them realized the problem there . The story just doesn't work that way . Unnecessary to add that I 'm a huge fan of the Sopranos . Otherwise , I certainly wouldn't care .  
  Standard " paint-by-numbers " monster fare , filled with a bunch of routine plot devices from big-creature movies . It 's like somebody had a deck of cards with plot ideas from other movies written on them , which were shuffled , and dealt . Whatever plot lines and characters came up in the deal were then tossed into the script . Characters are so cliché-ridden , that you can play a game of " Guess who ends up as a monster meal " after less than ten minutes into the movie , and probably get every single one right-including the order that they will get devoured . Many of the characters are so obnoxious , that you root for the creature to shut them up . Some of the main characters include : a Billy Idol clone who surfs with sharks , a loudmouth brat who flashes bankrolls , a Capt . Ahab guy with a vendetta , and Ahab 's girlfriend who does sleazy dances at a bar . Oh , and a big , big beast in need of anger management therapy . Along the way , people argue a lot , pretty girls run around with wet t-shirts , couples make out on exotic beaches , explosions occur , ruins of a shrine appear , and greasy-faced pirates drop by . Amusing , for the most part , but one thing bothered me : the callousness by characters when other people were killed . After one violent demise , they make one-liner jokes . I could almost hear rim shots . Overall , OK , if you have 90 minutes to waste , and you want to laugh at a so bad it's good movie . Otherwise , you may want to skip this one .  
  Although this seems to be quite an old show ( 2002 ) , I watched my first ever episode last night and I have to say it has to be the worst show . . . ever . I am not one for placing comments but I was so shocked that a show could exist that blatantly tries to pander to , and I am only assuming that this was their target audience , children under 12 years old or people with a less than average IQ . The episode I was subjected to last night contained so many disjointed story lines , tried to include EVERY possible plot summary imaginable and all the while trying to preach about friendship , family , religion and politics ! . Basic story that they covered in the episode : Frat House hazing gone wrong wrong with too much alcohol - Death Turns out to be Senators son who wants FBI to investigate . Death is actually murder by peanut allergy Senator thinks it could be his sworn enemy and childhood best friend who did this because Senator was taking money for his votes for legislation but eventually got a conscience and said ' no ' to mean mulit millionaire . Everybody a suspect but all have the usual alibi ( ex-girlfriend student shagging a married teacher so had to lie , disgruntled student who was reported by victim actually had life changing experience , Senators enemy did not pay desperate student to kill sworn enemies son , he gives money freely to lots of broke students ) . All the while the heroine of this dribble has her niece staying who is ' at that age ' and has a crush on a boy , who she eventually gets the courage to talk to with the assistance of her aunty , but only to dump him because the ' in ' girls says he is not good enough and so to keep in with them she dumps him . Don't worry , she gets back with boy after she learns the truth about life and the ' in ' girls drop her , Aunty also explains that God is the only one who truly she can rely on ( I was almost sick at this point ) . This ' drama ' gets even better when Sue and her FBI team find out who the killer is . . . your gonna laugh at this , i sure did . . . It is one of the Frat boys who only a year ago found out he was adopted and that his real dad is an International terrorist and he is trying to impressive real daddy by killing boy and planting bomb at funeral . . . . . . . The characters are cardboard the acting is cardboard the continuity is cardboard the story is cardboard Anybody who says that they love this show has cardboard for a brain Why the writers of this show have tried to pack in EVERY eventuality into the one show means that they obviously have no faith in the character development or actors capability to carry off a simple plot line . Watching this show is like watching ' Last Action Hero ' with Arnie killing 5'000 people with a tooth pick , except Arnie is a better actor ( wow , never thought there would be a day that i would say that ! ) In the words of the Simpsons beloved character ' comic book guy ' . . . . WORST TV SHOW . . . . . EVER .  
  Even Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd couldn't save this movie from laying an emu-sized egg . Based on the classic Phil Silvers TV series , it bombed because : A ) It was updated to the 1990s , and B ) The simple premise of the TV series was turned into a confusing , feeble and silly screenplay . The original TV series used a small cast of talented actors to portray lovable characters acting out simple yet hilarious pranks . To expand this premise into a 1990s movie was asking for trouble , and it shows . No one could pay me enough to sit through this stinker a second time .  
  I loved the first two movies , but this movie was just a waste of time and money ( for me and the studio ) . I 'm still wondering why they made this horrible movie . The thing with the plastic gun and with the toy car , that can go into another house are ridiculous . Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in the first two movies were so funny , but the terrorists in this one are so stupid and not funny . Believe me this movie is just a waste of time .  
  I 'm a Jean Harlow fan , because she had star quality . I don't think her movies are good and I don't even think that she was a good actress , but she certainly was Great in comedies . Every bit of comedy in The Girl from Missouri is very good . But this movie is perhaps more like a love story . Jean Harlow is wonderful in this one and you can forget the rest of the cast - their performances bring nothing new . It always impresses me much to think that Harlow 's beautiful body was that of an ill woman . Well , in this movie she does look beautiful .  
  This movie was a long build-up with no climax . People whom refer to the swordfight in the end as great must either be out of their minds , or have none . Way too often this movie got soft . I am not saying that soft movies are bad . But no matter how fond you are of sugar it should have no space on a T-bone steak . This movie was supposed to be about vengeance for crimes committed against a culture , but it ended up being a petty bar-brawl . And there was only one of them who actually knew what a sword was ; Tim Roth 's character ( and yes , he plays him well ) . Rob Roy was a weak " hero " with no knowledge of how to use a sword , and the way he " won " was a disgrace . As a drama this movie had it 's periods , but the best performance in it has to go the nature of Scotland . This is one tad breath short of being termed as " soap " in my book .  
  I wish more movies were two hours long . On the other hand , I wish more American Civil War movies were MERELY two hours long . " Gone with the Wind " , " Gettysburg " - that 's about the length I 've come to expect ; although those two at least entertained for however many hours they lasted ; and even " Gettysburg " lasted as long as it did because things HAPPENED in the course of it . By contrast Ang Lee 's film is bloated and uneventful . It actually feels as if it takes much less than two hours . That wasn't a compliment . It 's really no different to any other form of sensory deprivation : at the time it feels as though it will never end , afterwards it seems to have taken no time at all . The film gets off on the wrong foot , as Lee plays his interminable credits OVER the opening footage ( bad mistake ) in which we are introduced to some characters we take an instant dislike to and will later come to loathe . The central two are Jake , the son of German immigrants who are staunch supporters of Lincoln , and Jack , an equally staunch Southerner whose values Jake shares . ( I had to re-read that sentence to make sure I hadn't written " Jack " instead of " Jake " at some point or vice versa . ) The two go off to become " bushwhackers " - Southern militia who so strongly lust after revenge and violence that they can't even be bothered to join the official Southern army , which I presume they think is for sissies . I 'm afraid Lee lost me right there . It 's easy to feel for characters who make moral mistakes : if we have some independent reason to like them , or feel as if we know them in some way , then their moral flaws can make us care for them all the more . Not so here . We aren't properly introduced to Jake for at least an hour ; when we are , it becomes clear he 's a gormless pimple of a man , who isn't a confederate by choice so much as by habit - the kind of person who says and does what everyone around him says and does , whose psychology is purely immitative . The people he associates with are either just the same or positively evil in some uninteresting way . I found myself cheering whenever the Northern cavalry appeared on the screen . I thought : good - kill the rebels , end the damned war , let me go home . Aggravating this problem is the horrible , horrible dialogue . Everyone speaks in the same whining Southern accent . I 've heard accents from all over the English-speaking world and this is the worst of them all . I don't care if Southerners really did talk like that , it 's simply not fair to ask an audience to listen to it for two hours . And believe me , we do listen to it for the full two hours : Lee 's picture is a talky one , largely because characters take so long to say what they mean in their ungrammatical , say everything three times , folksy drawl . It would help if they talked faster , but not much . Can't these people find a more efficient language in which to communicate ? In short : the film is little but a gallery of uniformly unattractive characters with no inner life , who talk in an offensively ugly mode of speech , who don't bathe often enough , to whom nothing of interest happens , despite their being involved in a war . Good points ? Jewel was nice to look at , and so was the scenery . But I have complaints even here . The cinematography , nicely framed , looked as if someone had susbtituted colour film for black and white by mistake ; and as for Jewel , we were teased with her body , but never actually allowed to gaze upon it , which I think is the least we were owed .  
  This movie was two and a quarter excruciating hours . Someone please tell me what the point was ? I mean , I understand the historical setting . It 's supposed to be about a ragtag group of Confederate bushwhackers ( terrorists ? ) on the Missouri-Kansas frontier , taking revenge against all northern sympathizers and abolitionists during the U.S. Civil War . But aside from gratuitous violence there wasn't really much of a point to this movie . Perhaps it was a political statement ? That war is really nothing much more than gratuitous violence ? If that was the point it was done quite well , but I don't think that was the point . I think the producers really thought they were making a worthwhile movie here , but as far as I was concerned there was a complete lack of any plot . It seemed like I was watching a paperback novel come to life , with the characters looking like what you would see on the covers of such novels . This movie should be burned along with some of the towns this gang torched !  
  * SPOILERS * This was an ugly movie , and I 'm sorry that I watched it . Like Jan Kounen 's Dobermann , it suffers mostly from poor editing-or lack of it . It is as if the director was so in love with his work that instead of cutting the movie down to a pace that kept your attention , he added all of the footage he had shot together . There are maybe two cool scenes in the entire movie . One of them is * SPOILER * when Benkei is petrified and the camera starts spinning around him . That was cool-but okay , we got it ! Move on please ! The camera won't stop spinning around this guy ! There 's maybe one or two more cool scenes that I forgot about in this flood of mediocrity , but the last duel scene IS NOT ONE OF THEM ! It may be because unlike in the earlier sword-handling scenes , Shanao isn't masked-but just because the director couldn't find a stuntman who somewhat resembled Asano Tadanobu doesn't give him the right to go ahead and make up 80 % of the sword fight with extreme close-ups of sword clashes ! And all from the same angle , may I add . The director should learn from the American produced 1995 bullet-train ninja movie The Hunted ! I personally saw the village raid scene as a tribute paid to the social activists of the previous generation who were confronted by the police in the violent demonstrations of their college years . The situation where innocence is oppressed by an authoritative and armed branch of the government unwilling to understand seems to be a message common in the Japanese media , due to the strong influence of socialists and communists who are a political minority . The movie versions of GTO and Salary Man Kintaro are two other recent examples * END SPOILER * I don't understand . I just don't understand why people who don't speak the language of the movie find praise worthy material in this . Maybe the worst was lost in the translation . The ending of the movie-on which marketing played a lot , is a different interpretation of the legendary encounter between Shanao and Benkei . But that legend is not the most popular in Japanese folklore , and it is so detached from contemporary themes , that after 138 minutes of over played visual techniques , who cares how the director wants to re-interpret the story ! ? Director Sasaki Hirohisa of Crazy Lips said that there was an unpleasant trend among new Japanese directors to ignore Japanese audiences , and target their movies for foreign film festivals-in order to gain faster international fame . This works , although it doesn't make sense , because the point of an international movie fest is to introduce to the world what kind of movies are being made in other countries-what kind of movies people WATCH in those countries . Certainly not Gojoe and the like .  
  Jerry spies Tom listening to a creepy story on the radio and seizes the opportunity to scare his nemesis . I didn't find this particular episode that funny : the humour seemed rather constrained and the whole set up was kinda lame ( Jerry is essentially the ' bad guy ' in this one , tormenting poor Tom for no particular reason ) . There is the occasional flash of inspiration ( such as Tom 's literal ' heart in mouth ' experience , and the moment when his nines lives are sucked out of his body ) , but , on the whole , this effort lacks the frenetic pacing , excellent animation and sheer wit of most of T & J 's other cartoons .  
  To be clear from the get go , ' The Bagman ' is very , very , very bad . It suffers terribly in almost every aspect except for one : the finished product is such an awful film that it 's actually hysterically funny to watch . This is a very low-grade film . Budget constraints for the film should be obvious to anyone who watches even just the opening title sequence . I 'm not sure if much of the humour in the film was intended or not . For example , the movie takes place in ' Doomsville . ' Note to all prospective home buyers : if the town you 're moving to is called ' Doomsville , ' keep moving . Stephanie Beaton is quick to pull off her top for a pretty enthusiastic sex scene in the kitchen . I couldn't help but laugh because it has intentional humour ( she turns on the gas stove .. get it ? The sex is THAT hot ? get it ? ) and unintentional humour . The unintentional in this case is the music . It 's like the theme music for ' Chariots of Fire ' goes Electronica . Break out the computer and the synthesizers ! I realize that coming up with music for a small production like this is cost prohibitive . I really feel for them because the work here is so well-intentioned . The problem is that cheap music isn't necessarily good music . I haven't laughed so hard at sex on screen since ' Alone in the Dark ' with that ' Seven Seconds ' song ( I guess they were implying that poor old Mr . Slater was a bit .. quick on the draw ? ) . Even the end credits are hilarious . Intentional or not ? You be the judge : a pet dog and cat are part of the credited cast - and an animal wrangler was on set for them ! - The boom is credited to ' Mr B . Stick , ' and the 3rd Unit 's wardrobe ( Yep , they had a third unit ) is credited to K-mart . Maybe it 's just me , but I think the hilarity of this more than saves the film . The movie is very , very bad , but the goals of Stephanie Beaton , her friends and family are so well-intentioned in ' The Bagman ' that you can't help but like the movie they 've produced . ' The Bagman ' is bad but not dreadful . In its own sweet way , it even manages to be a bit endearing . It wears its flaws so honestly that you can't help but forgive them . " Better " films that try to hide the flaws are almost worse in a way . I guess this is just a film that knew who its audience was and was produced accordingly . Watch any number of movies and most of them will probably be a lot better than this . Some of them might look cheaper , or have worse acting , or sillier production value . They may not suffer terribly as ' The Bagman ' does from awful editing , sound , and foley effects . Mr B . Stick didn't do a very good job . The special effects look to be where most of the money went . They tend to be more funny than gruesome , although when the ' Bagman ' is finally unmasked at the end , the make-up job there is surprisingly well done . My 4 out of 10 is a little high but the humour helped a lot . This is an ideal movie to track down some night with a few friends and a few beers in hand . Great entertainment is to be had by anyone who seriously considers themselves B-movie or low budget film aficionados . All others should probably avoid with great prejudice .  
  Dear Friends and Family , I guess if one teen wants to become biblical with another teen , then that 's their eternal damnation - just remember kids , " birth control " doesn't mean " oral sex " , I don't care what the honor student says . On the other hand , even if the senator 's aid quotes himself as a " bit of a romantic guy " , he 's still only hitting on a high school girl . If she was my sister , I 'd eat this guys kneecaps . Other than that I found out that Mongolians don't kiss the same way the French do and that baseball players named Zoo like delicate undergarments . I think I 'd almost rather watch Richie Rich one more time than suffer the indignity of this slip , slap , slop . Thank you , and good night .  
  * CONTAINS SPOILERS * The truly exquisite Sean Young ( who in some scenes , with her hair poofed up , looks something like Elizabeth Taylor ) is striking in her opening moments in this film . Sitting in the back of a police car waiting to signal a bust , her face and body are tense and distracted . Unfortunately , once the bust is over Young 's strained demeanor never changes . This is one fatally inhibited actress . One has only to compare Young to the performer playing her coworker and best friend , Arnetia Walker , to grasp what is missing in Young . Walker is open , emotional , and at ease at all times .. in that there 's no apparent barrier between what she may be feeling and her expression of it . She is an open book . Young , on the other hand , acts in the skittish , self-conscious way you might expect your neighbor to act were they suddenly thrown into starring in a film . Basically , she doesn't have a clue . With this major void looming at the center of the movie , we 're left to ponder the implausiblities of the story . For instance , after Miss Young is kidnapped by the criminal she 's trailing and locked in a closet , she breaks the door down when left alone . Granted , she 's dressed only in a bra and panties , but in a similar situation , with a psycho captor due to return any moment , would you head for the door .. or take the time to go through his dresser , take out some clothes and get dressed ? I would guess that this and other scenes are trying to suggest some sort of mixed emotions Miss Young 's character is experiencing , but Young can not convey this type of complexity . There are a few affecting moments in the film , such as the short police interviews with the criminal 's past victims , but overall this is an aimless endeavor . It 's too bad Miss Young was replaced while filming the pair of comic book style films that might have exploited her limitations with some humor ( BATMAN and DICK TRACY ) , because her floundering while attempting to play actual people is oddly touching . Watching Miss Young try to act , at least in this " thriller " , is a sad spectacle .  
  Its plain to see why the makers of Scary Movie found it so easy to spoof these ' teen slasher ' movies . They are so unbelievably formulaic . And if Valentine had been released a year or so earlier , I 'm sure they would have been spoofing this film too - that 's if they found any actual original material to distinguish it from the Screams , I know what you did last summers , and Urban Legends . Valentine offers nothing new to this genre , except a better than usual ending which , of course , leaves lots of room for the inevitable sequel . As always , a masked psychotic killer stalks a bunch of beautiful young women , killing the main character 's friends , one by one , in typically over the top style . Lots of T & A on display , no character development , bad acting , and overly elaborate bloodshed . The thing I can't stand about these kind of movies is that they pass themselves off as ' who done its ? ' . The thing is that they aren't because the motive is only revealed once the killer has unmasked , and tells the main character who 's friends have now all been murdered . Usually something that was never made at all clear during the film anyway ( eg . main character 's mother 's uncle 's fishing partner kicked his friend 's father 's dog ) . Everybody still left alive throughout the film is a ' suspect ' , but they are more ' Red Herrings ' than suspects . As we all know at this point the main character manages an implausible escape and kills the unmasked psycho killer after the motive is revealed . Valentine followed this formula almost to the letter . * SPOILER ! ( mini spoiler anyway ) * In Valentine the motive was not revealed , but more , left for you to think about given that the film didn't quite conclude in the typical ' teen slash ' way . The issue is only part resolved , and the goal of the lead killer may or may not have been fulfilled by surviving the bloodshed and killing almost everybody . Will the killer want more , or were the demons truly vanquished ? This still didn't make Valentine a good film , instead it simply saved it from being as bad as usual , which still doesn't count for much . To anybody thinking of making another film along these lines , please don't . Originality is so important , and its hard to see any originality coming out of this genre .  
  You know you 're in trouble when the film your watching has numerous alternate titles . Generally it means that they tried and retried to hide the turkey in various markets . Such a turkey is The Brain Machine which has seven different titles . Its about some super secret government project that is suppose to be able to use a computer to read people but instead it drives people to kill each other or themselves , or something like that . Its filled with B level TV actors sitting in paneled room with lawn chairs trying to act a script that makes almost no sense . Its a turkey of the untastey kind . Avoid it .  
  An absolutely wretched waste of film ! Nothing ever happens . No ghosts , hardly any train , no mystery , no interest . The constant and BRUTAL attempts at comedy are painful . Everything else is pathetic . The premise is idiotic : a bunch of people stranded in the middle of no-place , because their train was held up for less than 3 minutes . What ? And the railroad leaves them no place to stay , in a heavy storm ? I think not . Oh , they can walk 4 miles across the dead-black fields . umm , yeah . Sure . Or , they can force themselves on the railroad 's hospitality , and stay at the ' haunted ' train station . A station which proved to be nothing but DEADLY BORING , utterly without ghosts , interest , or plot . So very terribly dull that this seems impossible . This ought to be added to the LOST FILMS list ! aargh !  
  I don't know why this conduct was ever tolerated in the movie business ! This movie ( short ) is gross ( to say the least ) ! It is a bunch of 5-7 year old children wearing diapers with big bobby pins , acting like adults ( and too much so ! ) . However , it is interesting because it is a good example of how " the good old days " may not have been so good after all ! ( Thank GOD we have laws against this kind of material now ! ) { This is one short from the " Shirley Temple Festival " }  
  may contain spoilers ! so i watched this movie last night on LMN ( Lifetime Movie Network ) which is NOT known for showing quality movies . THIS MOVIE IS AWFUL ! i am still amazed that i watched the entire thing , as it was terrible . could this movie contain any more stereotypes ? ( harping jewish mother who wants son to be a doctor , catholic family with priest sons , big big crucifixes in every room shown in the catholic family 's house , mexican whores , " bad " guy who is really a softie at heart , incredibly bad country accents ) GAG ! i was at first intrigued by the fact that i had never heard of this movie and after seeing that cheryl pollack and corin nemec were in it , i decided to stay awake until 4am to watch it . anyway , the only redeeming thing about this movie is madchen amick 's beauty . i suppose pollack 's and nemec 's acting is okay , but they have a horrid script to work with . unlike the other reviewer who commented on the lack of texan accents ( the movie is supposed to take place in austin and very few people there have a twang ) i think that the accents were there ( in supporting characters like mary margaret 's date and john ) and were unnecessary . they were also very very bad . i am so very tired of hollywood " southern " accents that sound nothing like the area where the accent is supposed to be from . and since it was supposed to take place in austin and shooting movies there in 1991 would not have been expensive , i fully expected there to be familiar shots of the town : the beautiful capitol building , the UT tower lit up for a winning football game , etc . none of these things were there . also , it takes about 5-6 hours to drive to mexico from austin . at one point in the movie , michael and his posse take off for mexico to lose their virginities and are able to drive off when it is dark ( during the summer and early fall it doesn't get dark in austin until 9pm or so ) , spend time in mexico getting drunk and having sex with mexican ( is there any other kind ? ) whores , and then return to austin by dawn . while this is theoretically possible it is NOT very likely . and if anyone has started school in the hill country ( usually the third week of august , but may have been in september in 1960 ) they know that unless they want to pass out from heat stroke they DO NOT wear their letter jackets ! in august and september in austin and the surrounding areas it is 90 + degrees . only people with no body temperature would be stupid enough to wear sweaters or letter jackets on the first day of school . all in all , a very bad made for tv movie experience .  
  Well ! What can one say ? Firstly , this adaptation is far too long at 4 hours , for the complexity ( or lack of such ) of the plot . The actors try really hard to make something of this film but there is too little content for the time available . Swayzee is really NOT a Quatermain character at all . After seeing Sean Connery 's interpretation of the great man in " The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen " , Swayzee really does not make the grade . This chap with the winchester repeating rifle has none of the strength , stature , subtlety , or humour needed for the part , and is upstaged by everyone including the witch doctor , who incidentally seems from my point of view to be more convincing as an actor than the rest of the cast . Some of the vistas are pleasing but there are silly mistakes in the cinematography . For example . When the happy team arrive at the water hole in the middle of the desert , their tracks are visible down to the oasis , just waiting for them to walk in them . Climbing out of the mine leads to an exit ( on the next shot ) nothing like the exit seen from the passage they have climbed through , et cetera . I was waiting for Doug McClure to appear at any moment . In some ways I wish he had . The leader of the Russians pursuing Quatermain is a shoddily created stereotypical character who just shoots at everything . Swayzee does quite well as the sad father , returned to London , who is unable to obtain the custody of his son . Swayzee should stick to that sort of thing . He is not able to carry the part of a courageous gentleman with a stout heart , experience of life , and sense of fair play . 4 out of 10 . Barely  
  The year 1934 was when Shirley Temple played three major movies and really began to make a name for herself . Unfortunately , the studios had to experiment to see what the public best liked about here . Two of those things were singing and dancing . Another was a short , interesting film that kept people 's attention and got their minds off The Depression . You know the other keys to Shirley 's successful films . This film achieved none of the above , despite the star presences of Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard and despite a very good director in Henry Hathaway . In addition , there are too many talky parts in here which become simply boring , and too many arguments between a sullen Lombard and Cooper . To top it off , you didn't get the normal feel-good ending which is what the public wants . I guess they learned after this movie .  
  First of all , Jenna Jameson is the best actress in this movie , and she 's just awful . This movie has every horror move cliché in imagination , and all badly played . The over-sexed teen couple . The comical ( not ) horny jock . The snotty cool chick . The creepy local color guy . The parental-type couple . The virginal chick who amazingly never dies in these films . The dialogue is so painfully awful and delivered with the depth of a wading pool . It 's almost like you 're wishing that they 'd all die sooner . I saw the rough cut of this film a while ago , but somehow , this just got worse . Sure , the funniest thing in here is the ghoul trying to eat Jameson 's implants , but that hardly rates even a rental of this dog . Avoid at all costs .  
  This film is so bad , it made me want to vomit . Poorly produced , a complete laugh free zone . Why in the name of god would you spoof a movie which to a degree is a spoof ( and a damn funny one at that ) as it stands ? The sets are laughable , the effects so bad that they aren't even laughable , and the acting farcical . It is a complete mystery why you would even consider watching this lump of garbage . National Lampoon once made Animal House , which people still consider to be completely and utterly hilarious . Now they 've been relegated to making TV movies like this lump of * . Name your expletive , and it could be accurately used to describe this film .  
  Although properly warned I actually sat down to watch this movie . In part because I usually give every movie an even break , and because I thought that a single movie couldn't be that bad . I stand corrected . Not even George Kennedy , Barry Bostwick or Ben Stein could save this turkey from sinking like a ton of bricks . Only once during this humor forsaken travesty of a spoof did I laugh . Namely during the Simon says scene . The other jokes are either poorly carried out or simply plain unfunny . And some of them you actually see coming a mile away . This movie just hasn't got what it takes to be a good parody like Airplane ! ( I + II ) , Naked Gun ( I + II + II ) , or Scary Movie . They all had A . funny gags , B . good dialog and most important of all C . unforgettable quotes . Men In White has got D . none of the above . To call this movie bad would be a gross understatement . AVOID THIS MOVIE ANYWAY YOU CAN ! CONSIDER YOURSELVES WARNED !  
  This movie really deserves the MST3K treatment . A pseudo-ancient fantasy hack-n-slash tale featuring twin barbarian brothers with a collective IQ of hot water , character names that seem to have been derived from a Mad Libs book , and such classic lines as " Hold her down and uncover her belly ! " , The Barbarians crosses over into the " so bad , it 's good " territory .  
  Watching this movie made me think constantly ; why are they making such a problem out of some broken brakes ? There are a million options to slow down the car ! In the movie Speed the writers a least thought of a good reason why the car wasn't able to stop .. There aren't many good things to say about this film ; all the usual narrative cliche 's make their appearance , the actors are very bad , the story is as leak as a sieve etc . That makes this movie a waste of time and money .  
  Without question one of the most embarrassing productions of the 1970s , GAOTS seems to really , REALLY want to be something important . The tragic truth is that it 's so entirely valueless on every level that one can't help but laugh . Reaching in desperation for the earthy elements of Ingmar Bergman 's films , it follows a city couple 's day in the wilderness .. they walk along a shady path , allthewhile pontificating like a U.C. Berkeley coffee clatch . Almost every line of tarradiddle dialog delivered here is uproariously bad ( " I feel that life itself is made up of as many tiny compartments as this pomegranate .. but is it as beautiful ? " ) After what seems like an eternity of absolutely nothing happening ( well .. OK .. we are treated to some nudity and a tepid soft sex scene ) , there is finally a VERY anticlimactic confrontation involving a pair ' Nam vets who are making the nature scene and performing some pretty harsh folk ballads with an acoustic guitar . Nothing at all eventful or interesting happens IN THIS ENTIRE FILM . I thought the Larry Buchanan picture " Strawberries Need Rain " was a weak example of a Bergman homage . " Golden Apples " is every bit as bad , but the ceaseless random verbiage it presents makes it memorably awful . 1/10  
  It 's unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera-work and busy ( but scratchy ) background score that accompanies this 1933 release . Although sound came into general use in 1928 , there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman , unhappily married , who deserts her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods . The most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband giving a lift to the young man for a ride into town , proceeding to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wife 's lover . In a frenzy of jealousy , he drives at top speed toward a railroad crossing but changes his mind at the last moment , losing his nerve . It 's probably the most tension-filled scene in the otherwise decidedly slow-moving and obviously contrived story . HEDY LAMARR is given the sort of close-up treatment lavished on Marlene Dietrich by her discoverer , but her beauty had not yet been refined by the cosmeticians as they were when she was transported to Hollywood . Her performance consists mostly of looking sad and morose while mourning the loss of her marriage with only brief glimpses of a smile when she finds her true love ( ARIBERT MOG ) , the handsome young stud who retrieves her clothes after a nude swim . The swimming scene is very brief , discreetly photographed , and not worth all the heat it apparently generated . The love-making scene , later on , is also artfully photographed with the sort of lyrical photography evident throughout most of the film-artfully so . More is left to the imagination with the use of symbolism-and this is the sort of thing that has others proclaiming the film is some kind of lyrical masterpiece . Not so . It 's disappointing , primitively crude in its sound portions ( including the laborious symphonic music in the background ) and certainly Miss Lamarr is fortunate that Louis B . Mayer saw the film and on the basis of it , gave her a career in Hollywood . He must have seen something in her work that I didn't . It 's apparent that this was conceived as a silent film with the camera doing all the work . The jarring " workers " scene at the conclusion goes on for too long and is a jarring intrusion where none is needed . It fails to end the film on the proper note .  
  OK , I really don't have too much to say about this film , other than this : I have seen over 4,000 films in my life , and more than 2,300 of those were horror films . While I have some difficulty deciding which is the best ( as opposed to my favourite , which I can tell you is George A . Romero 's DAWN OF THE DEAD ) , I can tell you without the slightest hesitation that Todd Sheets ' ZOMBIE BLOODBATH is the absolute worst horror film I have ever seen . There is simply nothing positive I can say about this film . The acting , the dialogue , the directing , the make-up , the music .. Every aspect of this film is simply so far below what is acceptable that it boggles my mind that this was ever even released . Even if you are a horror or zombie movie completist , please heed my warning and DO NOT waste your time on this garbage . There is no pleasure to be gotten from viewing this . You won't even get any laughs out of the utter ineptitude on display .. Trust me . Please .  
  Firstly I would like to point out that I only know of the show due to my younger sister always watching it . I find it the most annoying program on TV . There is nothing funny about any of the ' jokes ' and the canned laughter is unbearable . The show would work much better if filmed in front of a live audience . That way the laughter would show just how ' unfunny ' the show is . However I give credit to the acting talents of the young cast . It sickens me however to think that they 'll look back on the show in the future and see how bad their first TV show was . The show links in well with the overall annoying voices and style of the CBBC presenters . Why the youth of today need to be shouted at so much is beyond me . That is all .  
  The Priyadarshan / Paresh Rawal combo has been golden before with the likes of HERA PHERI and HUNGAMA so I went into the movie ( at an Indian multiplex ) with high hopes , especially after the slick promos . Unfortunately , like HULCHUL before it , this movie was a huge disappointment . Like others have commented , the premise of the movie , which was already stale to begin with , just gets stretched on and on without any development or additional layering . After a while , you just want the movie to end so you can go home ( if I had been watching this at home , it would have been much easier to cut my losses ) . Akshay Kumar 's performance is average at best and John Abraham should not try doing comedy again . The comedy aspects of the movie overall were pretty week . I only remember giggling like twice the entire movie . Definitely no sidesplitting belly laughs that consumed me in HERA PHERI or even to a lesser extent in AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA . Paresh Rawal had a few of his expected classic moments , but overall , because his role and character wasn't given much room to grow , he didn't make much of an impact in this film . Neha Dhupia , who makes only an appearance in the movie , was fun to look at while she was on screen . And some of the songs are fun . Especially the opening and closing songs of ADA and KISS ME BABY , respectively . Otherwise , you 're better off just passing on this movie .  
  This film is not devoid of charm and also shows a bit of warmth , but ultimately this effort is too vain and too strongly focussed on the leads . There is no doubt that Mary Tyler Moore knows what to do with all her screen time but she takes too much of the limelight away from the rest of the cast . Another problem is the overburdening of the script with cliches . The daughter who secretly drops out of college , an older woman finding it difficult to get a good job ( and first ends up with fairly demeaning work ) , the sleazy network executive with his executive toys who goes for glitz over substance , the journalist who sticks up for her beliefs , etc . There is nothing really wrong with any of these , i . e . they are all firmly rooted in reality , but in combination they are just too much and leave us with too much deja-vu and too few surprises .  
  This film seems to be a rip off of many movies that have dealt with the same subject in the past . Let the future viewer be forewarned that " Art Heist " doesn't add anything to the genre . Director Bryan Goeres has no clue what to do with the film . William Baldwin keeps reappearing in films , and frankly , one wonders if he has a great agent , or is it that directors and producers love his unusual goofy looks , complimented by that strange hairdo he sports in most of his movies . The only good movie in which he has appeared , is " The Squid and the Whale " , in which he only speaks two , or three lines . Ellen Pompeo , his leading lady , doesn't fare much better ; there is no chemistry between Ms . Pompeo and Mr . Baldwin . A movie to be seen at the viewer 's own risk .  
  Although in many ways I agree with the other reviewers comments . I find that the plot and idea are very good . Many of the supporting actors were very good . The fatal problem with this film is Ellen Pompeo . I am sure , I have never seen a less talented " actor " How this person has ever been in a film or on television , I cannot imagine . In my opinion she would be better as a greater at a Wal-Mart . To see a person with this low level of talent involved in paying roles , does beg the question .. " Who does she know " ? I would very much like to see this film re-made with some talent . I do not fault the writer for the failure of this film to be worth the time to view it .  
  1st watched 4/29/2007 - 4 out of 10 ( Dir-Mick Garris ) : Campy vampire-like Stephen King movie has so many strange and goofy elements that you start laughing over the extreme weirdness about 3/4 the way into the movie and you wonder if this movie might have a cult following for King fans . It 's the story of a mother and son who are sleepwalkers ( a shape-shifting feline-like , flesh eating , life needing , near extinct breed of humanoid ) who move from town to town searching for virgins to feed on to keep themselves alive . They come across as pretty normal upper-class folk except they are secret lovers and cats hang around the outside of their home , day and night . Cats are deadly to them , so they set traps in their yard to try and keep the population down . We get to see them break a couple of their necks when they attack ( which is also a first in my movie-going experience ) - hopefully no real cats were harmed in the making of the film . The boy is after a sweet girl that he has a crush on until he turns into a " sleepwalker " and then he just wants her body . There is so much campy uniqueness to this movie that it might have been better if it was an all-out satirical comedy on suburban life , but the director instead tries to scare you every couple minutes until you wish he 'd just get over it and bring out the gore . Eventually that happens and the movie winds down to it 's typical Stephen King downbeat ending . The movie is interesting because King 's humor comes thru more than usual but his weirdness is also very present and what you have is a movie that his fans will probably like and should have in their collection , but as a worthwhile movie experience it really doesn't cut it .  
  An interesting concept vampirism having something to do with a virus . ( but done several times by now ) Overall the movie is too long and drags a bit . The editing could have been tighter . I am sorry to hear about the problem with the credits . Maybe the movie was rushed to market . The lighting was too dark in places . But the worst technical problem is the audio . The level was good enough to hear the dialog , but many of the interiors have a echo sound to them , which is very distracting . Either they were not careful in the recording , or the sound mixing could have been better . Also too much background noise got through . The should have gotten someone to do sound effects for the martial arts scenes . The tinny clank of swords hitting together was not the sound of an epic battle . Especially in the combat scenes the editing needed to be tighter . Also the acting was a bit flat . I am sorry , but when I see that the same person writes and stars in a movie , in my experience it is a red flag . But it was a good effort so I gave it a 4 .  
  Mann photographs the Alberta Rocky Mountains in a superb fashion , and Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan give enjoyable performances as they always seem to do . But come on Hollywood - a Mountie telling the people of Dawson City , Yukon to elect themselves a marshal ( yes a marshal ! ) and to enforce the law themselves , then gunfighters battling it out on the streets for control of the town ? Nothing even remotely resembling that happened on the Canadian side of the border during the Klondike gold rush . Mr . Mann and company appear to have mistaken Dawson City for Deadwood , the Canadian North for the American Wild West . Canadian viewers be prepared for a Reefer Madness type of enjoyable howl with this ludicrous plot , or , to shake your head in disgust .  
  You know what kind of movie you 're getting into when the serial killer main character is being transported to the electric chair ( in what seems to be a bakery truck ) , only to have the prison vehicle collide with ( and I 'm not making this up ) a genetic engineering tanker truck . The goo which spurts forth melts him , and fuses his DNA with the snow , creating our protagonist , the killer snowman . My favorite portion of the movie , however , is an over-the-shoulder shot of the snowman thrashing some poor schmuck , in which his hands look suspiciously like a couple of white oven-potholder gloves . Mmm , schlock ..  
  The problem I find with this title is that I am not sure if the director is trying to produce a documentary or movie . A blend of the two genres just doesn't work and that leaves the whole thing hung in the middle of nowhere . This is more so as the director has picked the most extremes of what is supposed to be happening around our everyday life making it an unconvincing documentary . If it is meant to be a thriller / drama this is too dull and monotonous . In either case , what is the moral or the message which the director is trying to convey to the audience ? That around us there are people who ill-treat others who are willing to be ill-treated ? That there are many crazy lunatics around us ? So .. so what ?  
  This film is totally garbage . Some imbecilic intellectual comforting himself by making all his best to claim superiority of aristocrat over working class . Nothing more than a piece of self-complacence catharsis . Disgusting . If this kind of a movie is set in US , it will sure make itself a big joke . And simply because it comes out from ' the other side ' , it makes itself a masterpiece , a wonderful amusement for certain brain-washed and / or brain-washing westerns ( some George W . maybe : ) . A typical cold-war sequelae , some kind of joke anyway . I would say , if this - like expressed in this film - is all what Soviet intellectuals had been thinking about all those years , then maybe they deserve all the miseries they claim they had gone through . BUT NO ! ' cause like many others , I 've read and watched real masterpieces made by real outstanding Soviet intellectuals . For example , something also relevant with dog , " White Bim Black Ear " - both Gavriil Troyepolsky 's book and Stanislav Rostotsky 's movie - is a real masterpiece . Real life , real tragedy , real sad , real pride and dignity , one of the real best of the Soviet era .  
  For some strange reason the film world is driven by fashion . Someone makes a film about a killer shark then all of a sudden the film world ` s oceans are awash with giant Squids , killer octopusses and sea monsters of every ilk . A man is stalked by an erstwhile lover from hell then every film character is stalked by a cop from hell or a flatmate from hell or a babysitter from hell . Then when a major Hollywood company produces a big budget FX laden blockbuster about tornados then other film producers jump upon the bandwagon , the fact that they don ` t have the budget to pull it off doesn ` t stop them . NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS is a case in point . What struck me about this made for television film is the fact that it tries to hide its lack of budget by cutting to the ad breaks . Everytime a tornado appears the camara locks onto the horrified expression of the actors as they scream things like " Oh my gawd it ` s heading this way " and " Run for your lives " then the screen fades to black saving the producers the need to up the special effects budget . Unfortunately NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS budget should have been upped to include better actors . The cast are by no means bad but they are unimpressive and lack the skill to carry a film which is character driven . Where ` s Josh Hartnett and Elijah Wood when you need them ? And the last word on this being a TWISTER clone .. Yes NOTT was released a couple of months before TWISTER but TWISTER had been hyped for several months as being the Summer blockbuster of 1996 and NOTT has a rushed feeling to it which leads me to believe that it was made and released to tie in with the hype surrounding TWISTER  
  If you don't mind having your emotions toyed with , then you won't mind this movie . On the other hand , if you enjoy British crime mysteries , following clues and seeing how they all logically fall into place at the end , you 'll be very disappointed . Here are some of the logical inconsistencies that lead to that disappointment : * While the police utilize the CCTV cameras early on to gather clues about the mystery , the huge truck that stopped and blocked the children 's view just before her disappearance doesn't get caught on camera . This is a critical piece of the mystery . It 's inconsistent to have the car the children were in caught on camera and not the big truck that is so critical to the mystery . * The movie goes to great lengths to show the sophistication of the equipment in tracking down the children 's movements but misses the opportunity to utilize the same sophisticated equipment is tracking down vehicles that may have entered the crime scene from camera-visible locations adjacent to the crime scene as part of developing clues . * In England , driving is on the left . The director goes out of his way to have the car at the crime scene park on the right , several meters away from the flower kiosk , when it could have easily parked immediately behind , or even on the side ; as the huge truck did . * The police forensics team is so meticulous as to find a discarded cell phone in a sewer drain several miles from the scene of the crime , but can't find any blood evidence from the head injury right at the crime scene , even though they secured the scene just hours after the disappearance and with no intervening rainfall . * Search dogs were not used at all to find the missing children ; this from the country that is well known for developing the hound dog for search and hunting . * It is illogical that such a highly publicized news story would not turn up the presumably innocent truck driver that stopped at the flower kiosk . * It is illogical that the mother would go to such extremes and expend so much effort to leave carpet fiber clues under her fingernails for her eventual murder investigators even coaxing her daughter to do the same - while she simply could not have crawled out of the unguarded mobile home . If she had enough sense about her to ask her daughter to get carpet fibers under her nails , she could of just as easily asked her daughter to call out for help or even leave the mobile home that was in a crowded residential park . * The suspect that abducted the little girl was portrayed as mentally slow / dimwitted - justifying his unknowingly drowning of the mother but , he was smart enough not to cooperate with the police and also fully exercise his rights not to self-incriminate . There are more inconsistencies like this that will lead to a true sleuth aficionado 's disappointment . ' Five Days ' is a very weak British crime story .  
  Sistas in da hood . Looking for revenge and bling bling . Except da hood is a wild west town in the late 1800s . I do not remember any westerns like this when I was growing up . What would Randolph Scott say ? If he saw Lil ' Kim , he might say , " Alright ! I have to admit that I tuned into this just to see her . Bare midriffs and low cut blouses are not the staple of the usual cowboy flick , but these are the cowgirls , and they are fine . Now , don't go looking for any major story here , and the usual stuff of ghetto crime drama are here in a different setting . And , when 's the last time you heard John Wayne call someone , " Dawg " ? And , I don't remember the Earp brothers hugging and kissing before they marched to the OK Corral . I watch this on BET , so I missed the action that got it an R rating , but I doubt if I will buy the DVD to see it unless I can be assured it was Lil ' Kim in that action .  
  Alright , I got passed the horrible acting . I got passed the fact that Lil Kim was blasting some cannons and her arms or hands weren't moving , I got passed the weaves , I got passed the colored contacts . This is what killed it for me : In the scene where the four roses were sitting at the table arguing . Lisa-Raye and Monica Calhoun stand up and , and then Lil Kim gets up to break up any hostilities by saying , " Whoa , Whoa , Whoa , Hold up . Let 's CHILL OUT here for a HOT SECOND . " I am a fan of the western movie genre , and I never heard anyone talk slang like this in any of Clint Eastwood 's movies . If anyone thinks this movie deserves over a 1 rating , please tell me another movie that 's worse than Gang of Roses . I 'm through .  
  This is a terrible movie , terrible script , bad direction and nonsensical ending . Also , bad performances , except from Clancy Brown who is criminally underused here , and Michael Pollard . Watching this movie was purgatory-you do it to unload enough bad movie karma to actually see a good one further down the line . The movie presents a father and son who look like they couldn't every possibly have been related . The part of the male lead is not well written and seems uncharismatic in this role . You can see the plot points a mile away . The actions of the female lead and that of her brother , the cop , also make no sense . So , a major action on her part at the end of the movie makes no sense script-wise .  
  I have been learning about the Zodiac for four years now . And I 'm not saying I know much more than anyone else .. in fact out of most of the people who know and read and learn about Z , I am prolly the one with the least knowledge .. But I do know or at least I think I know that most of the stuff in this wouldn't happen .. From how he signed his name .. to how he killed people .. I thought that Godfather was the worst film ever .. The cinematography was that of a five year old .. not saying that my films are any better but I am not someone who is making movies for the mass population .. The acting I thought for the most part was pretty good really I did .. the lead didn't talk that much on camera or at all I forget and don't know because I stopped watching .. his voice overs where good .. But really spend the four dollars and 70 cents on something else .. like a large pizza or something .. Until I learn how to write a review , Psycho Phil  
  After too many bad memories , I took to skipping this episode each time it showed up in the Season 2 sequence . I recently watched it again just to remind me why . I 've always considered this the worst ST : TNG episode ( with the exception of " Shades of Gray , " which barely counts as an episode at all ) . I keep listening to the clunky dialogue and thinking of the script red-penciled by the author 's Writing 101 teacher : " SHOW , DON'T TELL ! " From Deanna Troi 's pronouncement , and everyone else 's constant elbowing reminders about what a charming , dangerous rogue Okona is , to Guinan 's explanation about how funny her droid joke is ( it isn't ) , to the who-cares resolution to the conflict , there isn't a plot point that isn't highlighted and triple-underlined for our edification , and there ain't a believable moment in any of it . Unfortunately , Bill Campbell , a charming actor in other circumstances , is too puppy-dog huggable to be the center of the machinations of the plot . On the other hand , it could be that no one short of John Barrowman ( Jack Harkness from " Doctor Who " ) could pull of this underwritten placeholder of a role . ( Zero points , by the way , to the Data subplot . While I think Joe Piscopo stopped being funny decades ago , he and Brent Spiner had nothing to work with here . Although the Jerry Lewis bit was funny in a stupid way . ) On a good day , you may be able to think of this as a charming little homage to a lesser Original Series episode . Me , I 'd rather skip ahead to " Time Squared " or " Q Who . "  
  At what point exactly does a good movie go bad ? When does a movie go from " watchable " to " where 's that & ^ @ _ + # ! * OFF switch " ? Thank goodness for DVDs , like this one , that can be borrowed from the library - for free ! Likewise , thank goodness for the " fast forward " switch on the DVD player . I feel sorry for those people who were duped at the box office . At one point ( I 've forgotten exactly when because now it 's all just a blur ) , our " hero , " Luke Wilson starts running through traffic ; I think he was looking for a cab . It was at that point when I gave up , realizing I couldn't care whether he found his ride or got run over by a garbage truck . The last time the movie was interesting was when Luke Wilson climbs out of the dumpster , hair dryer in hand , and first meets the " heroine , " Uma Thurman . That scene ended with the purse-snatching criminal dangling helplessly from the fire escape far , far above the departing Luke and Uma . That was the last time the movie was funny , and when was that scene ? Ten minutes into the flick ? Every time the movie tried to become " funny , " it couldn't . Every time the movie approached " excitement , " it fizzled out , heading in the opposite direction . When a musical score might have helped squeeze life out of this dullard , the sound track stayed empty and silent . The sex scenes were not needed and were beyond lame ; the damage to sets and props unnecessary and childish . When Uma turns into the crazy ex-girlfriend , I felt like I was watching " The 40 Year Old Virgin Meets Pulp Fiction " ; that 's when I realized that there was no turning back because I thoroughly disliked " The 40 Year Old Virgin " and " Pulp Fiction . " Luke Wilson 's sidekick , Rainn Wilson ( also seen in the dreary " The Last Mimzy " ) adds nothing but insult to injury in this awful movie . Rainn Wilson , the King of Television Boredom , should stay with that equally awful medium . Hey , Rainn Wilson ! Leave full-length motion pictures alone ! Every time Uma 's rival , Anna Faris , came on screen , I expected Jason or Freddy or some fright flick monster to jump out from behind the scenery ; once you see Anna Faris in " Scary Movie , " that 's all you ever see , no matter the movie , no matter the medium . The character played by Wanda Sykes was just plain awful and was so out of place in this flick .  
  Bernard Rapp passed away last year and was a very cultured journalist . Cinema was one of his biggest passions ( he penned a vast worldwide dictionary of films ) and so he was bound to wield a camera at least one time in his life . But the films he left garnered lukewarm reviews : " Tiré à Part " ( 1996 ) in spite of Terence Stamp 's sensational performance was very caricatured in the depiction of the characters , " une Affaire De Goût " ( 2000 ) was a slick affair even if Bernard Giraudeau delivered a perverse performance , " Pas Si Grave " ( 2003 ) was another let-down and " un Petit Jeu Sans Conséquence " is as underwhelming as its predecessors . Its comic potential is exploited in a flimsy way . And however , the starting idea let predict a twirling , spiritual comedy . A couple held by Yvan Attal and Sandrine Kiberlain who invited their friends is in full moving in a lascivious mansion . To play with their guests , they pretend to part company with each other . And things don't go as planned because the announcement of their separation doesn't surprise them . The two lovers start to ponder about the validity of their couple . In spite of lush scenery and the promising material he had at his disposal , Rapp 's undistinguished directing can't manage to give life to this game with unexpected consequences . The plot follows a well-worn pattern with characters who have specific well-known functions and masks that are unveiled about who they really are . Verbal or situation comic effects often fall flat . A bad editing fades a little more the film with this bad habit from Rapp to abruptly cut many sequences . Even the actors ' sincere input in the venture is debatable . They seem to be bored and to recite their texts than to live them , especially Sandrine Kiberlain . The audience is soon caught in a deep torpor . It 's regrettable to say it : Bernard Rapp 's films never lived up to his intentions as " un Petit Jeu sans Conséquence " bears witness .  
  Jason Alexander is a wonderful actor , but it 's ridiculous to cast him as a cuddly romantic lead . The fact that he dances so well , croons so effectively , and throws himself into the part so completely somehow just made him seem all the more creepy . In his more cutesy moments ( with the girl in the train station , in the final number with Rosie ) , I couldn't take my eyes off him he was so repellent . You keep expecting him to drop the nice-guy act and start snarling . Vanessa Williams was the real star , the only performance that was better than the 1963 movie . By the way , if you see a production of the stage musical , the 1963 movie and this 1995 movie , you 'll see three versions that have more revisions ( different songs , same songs assigned to different characters and in different situations ) than any other musical I 've ever seen .  
  This movie surely has one of the strangest themes in history - right up there with Ed Wood 's impassioned defense of cross-dressing in " Glen or Glenda ? " The subject : playing bridge . The Park Avenue set plays it ; the Bohemians play it . The Russians - who speak very questionable " Russian " and have most unconvincing accents when they speak English - play it at the restaurant where they work . If one isn't interested in bridge , one - even despite the great cast - isn't likely to be much interested in this bizarre movie . Loretta Young and Paul Lukas are fine . ( Well - Frank McHugh is an unlikely ghost writer - as Lukas is an unlikely Russian . ) But they are all sunk by the fetishistic script .  
  This film was really bad whether you take it as a sci-fi movie , as a horror one or even as a comedy . The whole thing is ridiculous . The film looks ( and is ) definitely cheap , the actors have no idea of what acting is and the script shows clearly that it was being made along with the shooting . It is obvious that the monster in the closet was added because the living head was not scary at all - she was even pretty - and they thought they needed something more impressive ; they failed here too ( the make up is awful even for the late 50 's , rather funny ) . The film shows clearly why Director Joseph Green 's career as such and also as a writer never materialized ; he was really bad at both . Same goes to the actors , leading and supporting . " The Brain That Wouldn't Die " ' s best achievement is its short running time .  
  All I can say after watching Snitch 'd is please stop Mr . Cahill . It is painfully clear you have no understanding of what you make movies about . If you insist on making movies about gangsters I urge you to do research . It 's comical to watch movies with absurd gangbangers that even sound more absurd when they speak . I laughed at the part when Mr . Cahill goes to a school with only 3 students and proceeds to kick their butts in kung fu fashion . This movie was tough as an after school special . Who had the idea to have hats worn that say where a particular gangbanger was from ? . I suspect real gangbangers do not wear hats claiming there gang . That would be stupid considering new laws that add length to a prison term if a person is gang related . Snitch 'd is the WORST gangbanger movie ever made .  
  Sadly , Marry Harron decided to do a fictional account of Bettie Page 's life to go along with her own issues with men . As typical in all her work , every major male character is portrayed as weak , bumbling , or twisted . To add to her fiction , she projects ideas and issues that are not true , according to Bettie Page herself . Bettie did not leave the biz because she thought it was morally wrong or had religious issues ( though she became a born-again later in life , through the influence of her 3rd husband - a minister ) . She left it , because she was in her late 30 's , her acting career had gone nowhere and she felt she was losing her looks . The hints of molestation and rape are unvalidated and denied in Bettie 's own words and are the director 's attempts to claim that any woman who did what Bettie did must have been victimized by men . Harron fails to point out that Bettie designed her own clothes in almost all her shoots ( not handed to her by " sick " fetishists ) . Harron also fails to make a point that Bunny Yeager , who did many famous photo shoots of Bettie , also did many " naughty " shoots with Bettie and was not the morally upright professional photographer portrayed in the film . The only saving grace is Gretchen Mol looks very much like Bettie . Otherwise , there are other movies and documentaries more accurate and honest to her life and the people in it .  
  I saw this DVD in my friends house and thought that this was a Turkish action movie with some Hollywood-not very big-names in it . Interested enough I decide to give it a shot later .. It was a tough to bear experience believe me . Then , after finally seeing the credits roll I tought ' We Turks really suck at Hollywood style film making .. This is an insult to the heist|hostage movie genre .. ' but then wait ! I checked some names and no , they were not Turkish names and no , this was not a Turkish movie ; on the contrary it was literally shot in America with an American director & crew ! That made me thinking-again ! - How on earth can you persuade names like Micheal Madsen , Edward Furlong or even Arnold Vosloo to take part in such a project ? with money probably .. That kept me thinking further .. How can you raise such amount of money to offer them and a supposedly international cast ? Then all my meditation paid off and I came to find the answer . By hiring the cheapest equipment and crew that you can find . And if you still have to difficulty in adjustin your budget then : by writing and directing the movie you are trying to produce-or vice versa I don't have any information on that - . So bottom line this is not a bad movie as everybody are so anxious to present as .. It makes you think - in my case even meditate - and there are a lot of movies outthere that doesn't give even that affect .. This one at least makes you think ; It makes you wonder .. It leaves you with disbelief .. and then It makes you wonder again ..  
  Years have gone by since Don Wilson used his martial arts expertise to take down a robot who was programmed to destroy him , he 's also married to the blonde reporter ( Stacie Foster ) who led the rebellion in the first film , now a new conspiracy is in the works , one that involves look-alike droids who frame our two heroes , and a corporation looking to rule the world ( There is no plot to back any of this up ) and Cyber Tracker 2 becomes a virtual replay of the first movie . I admit that I have bought DVDs from the bargain bin that were made by PM , PM was a company that specialized in cheap-jack action flicks ( like this ) which had tons of explosions , little story and overall nothing but mean edged action . Some of these titles have been ( mildly ) enjoyable ( Last Man Standing and The Sweeper ) however Cyber Tracker 2 is stuck with the casting of the charisma-less Don Wilson . When comparing the protagonists of similar PM efforts both Jeff Wincott and C . Thomas Howell are Oscar nominees when compared to Don Wilson . Another telling sign is that this was directed by Richard Pepin who has none of the flair Joseph Merhi seems to have in crafting action sequences that feel much more expensive than their budgets . Then again though both C . Thomas and Wincott are probably more expensive to obtain . Cyber Tracker 2 is a rip off with a capitol R , there are so many steals from better movies ( Robocop , Terminator , Universal Soldier to even Halloween II ! ) that it 's almost as if Richard Pepin is trying to infuse a sense of identity to the pedestrian material yet without the intelligent ideas or at least the mindless zip of great action , Cyber Tracker 2 falls flat . There is literally no good idea that isn't borrowed from a better movie and the supporting cast overact . The only exception comes from Tony Burton who is miles better than the material . Also Stacie Foster looks like she could be better with far better material . However Cyber Tracker 2 comes off mainly as noisy , bland and lackluster as its leading man , however with no real martial arts sequences to fall back on , all there is , is lots of cars tipping over and that alone is no substitute for the bankruptcy of ambition expressed here . * 1/2 out of 4- ( Poor )  
  I dunno what the hype around this is .. This is really a bad movie .. it did nothing to me , the only descent scene is where everyone comes together at the party , and a nice song is playing , uplifting beat and nice cinematic shots that make you move .. that was the best part of the movie .. Otherwise this film lacks everything to suck the viewer in There 's no story , there 's nothing to think about like some people say , there 's no cohesion between the different stories .. it was more of an attempt to re-do Anderson 's ' Magnolia ' which was brilliant , but it fails blatantly .. Okay it 's light and easy to watch , but that are movieclips too . Maybe first write a story before you make a movie .. 4/10 One of the worst Belgian movies I 've seen  
  I´m not surprised that even cowgirls get the blues if this movie is anything to go by . I expected something better from Uma Thurman , which was the reason I suffered my way through this experience in the first place . An awful film with only the music as a redeeming quality . It´s just a shame that we are incapable of giving 0 out of 10 in these reviews . This movie deserves it .  
  I love movies . I love independent efforts and major studio productions . I love films with stars and I love those featuring unknowns . I love dramas , comedies , action-adventures , science fiction , mysteries , westerns , any genre except horror . I love foreign films as well as those in English . I love good movies and I even love bad ones , because almost no film ever fails to entertain or amuse on some level . Except for " Even Cowgirls Get the Blues . " When I attended a late-night showing of " Cowgirls , " I joined an audience of around 10 . Less than halfway into it , I alone remained . Soon not even I could tolerate the disturbing mess unfolding before my eyes , and I left as well . To this day " Cowgirls " remains the only movie I have ever walked out of . I don't quite know how to describe this incoherent , vacuous , trashy , meaningless film , or how to adequately convey its lack of redeeming value . Suffice to say that it ranks as one of the worst major films of all time , preposterous and inexcusable on every level . It tries to be clever , but its conception of feminism seems hopelessly anachronistic . It tries to be funny , but its humor is coarse and cringe-worthy . This is one of the few films which manages to profane its own ethos , by depicting protagonists in so off-putting a manner that you revolt against them and their values . If you want to watch a movie , watch " Waterworld , " " Ishtar , " anything but this . Except for the new " Alexander . " If you 're choosing between that and this , read a book instead .  
  This movie was strange .. I watched it while ingesting a quarter of psilcybe cubensis ( mushrooms ) . It was really weird . Im pretty sure you are supposed to watch it high , but mushrooms weren't enough . I couldn't stop laughing .. maybe lsd would work . The movie is a bunch of things morphing into other things , and dancing . Its really cheesy for todays standards but when it was released im sure it was well .. one of a kind . I could see how some people would think this movie was good , but I didn't think it was very interesting , and I was on mushrooms at the time . If your having a party or something and everybodys pretty lit , pop it on you 'll get a few laughs .  
  There are probably more people afraid of the dentist than of , let 's say , little monsters or scary looking dolls . Which makes it a perfect subject for a horror movie , really . Dr . Feinstone ( Corbin Bernsen ) has been a successful dentist for several years now , but when he catches his wife cheating on him with the poolguy he snaps , and he brings his anger and frustration to his work . Well , give a mad dentist a drill and a mouth , and you can probably guess what happens next .. As I said , brilliant idea but not delivered as well as it should . In particular the ending is a huge let down . Last note : watch for Mark Ruffalo ( You Can Count On Me , Eternal Sunshine .. ) in this one . 5/10 .  
  The opening scene of this film sets the pace for the entirety of its ninety minutes . The shots are generic , conventional , and of television movie quality . The snow drenched scenery is gorgeous , yet the characters held with in it have a similar quality to that of looking at a photograph of such scenery , the overwhelming feeling being that of distance . Some of the editing is fairly high quality and the work of an veteran professional , the dialogue however is clunky and artificial , having little bearing on ' real ' conversations at all seemingly . Any emotional insight is displaced in favour of swearing , which is of course the way in which everyone shows their true feelings . The action is slow and underwhelming , the overall feeling being one of someone trickling cold water over your head , but so slowly that you barely notice , yet eventually you feel pathetic and slightly sorry for yourself for being caught in such a incomprehensible situation . The mixture of genres that the Fessenden has seemingly tried to use ; psychological thriller , horror and family drama , although commendable suffers from a serious lack of tension and interesting dialogue . The way in which the husband , wife and child trio interact is particularly unrealistic . The themes of family relationships being played out in haunting setting have been covered countless times before by far superior films , an instant example being that of The Shining ( 1980 ) . The family unit here are torn by innocuous troubles which are hard to understand or sympathise with considering the relative ambiguity of the script . The family unit is hardly stalked throughout the film , Fessenden playing down the thriller possibilities of the narrative in favour of a slow family drama for the majority of the running time . The ' stalker ' figure Otis has few apparent motives for his behaviour and despite being perhaps the most interesting and well acted character is still very underdeveloped . The main characters are empty husks of people who it was extremely hard to relate to , their relationships with each other being particularly void of any sentiment or feeling . Although the ignorance of the Erik per Sullivan 's young character by his parents is presumably part of the story , surely any reasonable person would question their son if he allegedly spoke to someone who seemingly doesn't exist ? People can accept this film as intelligent because of its relative lack of conventional aspects regarding creature based horror movies but this film fails in respect of whichever genre you wished to pigeonhole it in . You can read deep psychological meanings into every single minute detail of anything if you should so wish to but I think people would be better off over analysing their carpet for some deep emotional meaning , rather than these vacuous sub-human creations .  
  Uninspired direction leaves a decent cast stranded in a handsome but bland adaptation , in which dialogue seems recited rather than heartfelt , and cash strapped appearances by the ghosts fail to round up any sense of awe or magic ; Edward Woodward , as the Ghost of Christmas Present , wobbles around on stilts and seems to be doing an impression of Bernard Cribbins . As Scrooge , George C . Scott is too wry , and he never seems to truly believe in it , which robs his performance of its effect . The scenes in which he 's shown his past have as much impact as if he was half-heartedly flicking through his family album . No one else seems to be putting any effort in , except Frank Finlay , who chronically overacts .  
  The fact that this movie made it all the way to the rentalrack in Norway is bizarre . This movie is just awful . This image quality is just one teeny bit better than you get of a mobile phone and the plot is soo bad . The main character is just plain annoying and the rest just suck . Every person affiliated with this movie should be ashamed . The fact that the people that made this movie put their name on this is extraordinary . And the distributors ; did they even see it ! ? This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen . To label this a comedy is an insult to mankind . I urge you not to support this movie by buying or renting it .  
  This is listed as a documentary , it 's not , it 's filmed sort of like a documentary but that I suspect was just because then they get away with a shaky camera and dodgy filming . This has just been released in the UK on DVD as an " American Pie style comedy " it 's not that either . Basically it follows around a group of teens on spring break as they go to Mexico for cheap booze and with the quest being to get there virgin friend finally laid . Throw is a couple of dwarfs , also on the same sort of quest and you have a non-hilarious tale of drunk teens trying to get some girls . Considering the 18 Rating this has very little nudity , and practically zero sex scenes , mainly I guess the rating is for swearing of which there is plenty . If you like crude Jackass behaviour without the humour , then this may be your thing , if you have any brain cells left then I would probably avoid this !  
  Are you familiar with concept of children 's artwork ? While it is not the greatest Picasso any three-year-old has ever accomplished with their fingers , you encourage them to do more . If painting is what makes them happy , there should be no reason a parent should hold that back on a child . Typically , if a child loves to paint or draw , you will immediately see the groundwork of their future style . You will begin to see their true form in these very primitive doodles . Well , this concept of children 's artwork is how I felt about Fuqua 's depressingly cheap and uncreative film Bait . While on all accounts it was a horrid film , it was impressive to see Fuqua 's style begin emerging through even the messiest of moments . If you have seen either Training Day or King Arthur , you will be impressed with the birth of this director in his second film Bait . While Foxx gives a horrid , unchained performance , there are certain scenes , which define Fuqua and demonstrate his brilliance behind the camera . Sadly it only emerged in the final thirty minutes of the film , but if you focus just on those scenes , you will see why Fuqua 's name appears on so many " Best Of " film lists . I will never disagree with someone that Fuqua 's eye behind the camera is refreshing and unique . His ability to place a camera in the strangest of places to convey the simplest of emotions is shocking . I am surprised that more of Hollywood hasn't jumped aboard this bandwagon . Even in the silly feature Bait , you are witness to Fuqua 's greatness . Two scenes that come directly to mind are the explosion scene near the middle of the film and the horse scene close to the end . In both of these scenes I saw the director Fuqua at work . Alas , in the rest of this film , all I saw was a combination of nearly every action film created . The likable hero down on his luck that suddenly finds his life turned around by some unknown force is a classic structure that just needs to die in Hollywood . We have seen this two often , and no matter who you are ( unless you are Charlie Kaufmann ) , you cannot recreate the wheel . It is just impossible with this genre , and it is proved with Bait . I was annoyed with Fuqua for just sitting back and allowing this to happen , which could explain why it took me three viewings to finish this film . I was just tired of the structure , and while I hoped that Fuqua would redefine it , he did not . Then , there was the acting . While Jamie Foxx has never impressed me as an actor , I was willing to give this helmed vehicle a try . I wanted to see if he could pull off another dramatic role similar to Collateral . I was under the impression that perhaps this was the film chosen to show producers that Foxx could handle the role in Collateral . Again , I was disappointed . Foxx was annoying . Not in the sense that it was the way that his character was to be , but in the sense that it felt as if neither Fuqua nor Foxx took the time to fully train Foxx on what should be ad-libed and what should be used to further the plot . Instead , we are downtrodden with scene over scene of Foxx just trying to make the audience laugh . Adding second long quips and culture statements just to keep his audience understanding that he was a comedian first , an actor second . Fuqua should have stopped this immediately . Foxx 's jokes destroyed his character , which in turn left me with nothing solid to grasp ahold of . Instead of character development , he would crack a joke . Neither style worked , no joke was funny . The rest of the cast was average . By this I mean I have seen them all in similar roles . They were brining nothing new to the table , nothing solid to the story , and nothing substantial to the overall themes of the film . They were pawns filling in dead air space . Fuqua had no control over this mess , and the final verdict only supports that accusation . Overall , this was a sad film . With no creativity in sight and unmanaged actors just trying to upstage themselves , what originally started as a decent story eventually sunk faster into the cinematic quicksand . Foxx was annoying , without character lines , and a complete bag of cheese . In each scene I saw no emotion , and when emotion was needed to convey a message , he chose to take his shirt off rather than tackle the issues . Are my words harsh ? I don't think so . When you watch any movie you want to see some creativity , some edible characters , and themes that seem to hit close to home . Bait contained none of these . While I will give Fuqua some credit for two of the scenes in this film , the remaining five hundred were disastrous . Apparently , I took the bait when renting this film , but now having seen it , hopefully I can stop others from taking that curious nibble . Grade : * out of * ( for his two scenes that were fun to watch )  
  There are just so many things wrong with this movie . To begin with , the first twenty minutes of the film could have been compressed into just five or maybe ten . The overall movie is ( mercifully ) short already , but this could have been made up for by giving a little more attention to the Mean Lion ( how did the miss a reference to " The Wiz " on that one ? ) and working his subplot a little more closely into the main plot . In short , the script had the seed of a good idea , but needed quite a bit of reworking . Second , it could have done without the crude humor . The original also had some that it could have done without , but at least there it was almost an afterthought - here , flatulence and urination abound . Third , the show is a little too self-aware . The original series had that well enough , as did the first movie , but here it 's just way , way too much . The Brendan Fraser in-jokes were just a bit over the top ( and why no mention of the " new Ursula " ? ) . Other gags with the Narrator , especially a couple of interactions near the end , also exceed good sense . Fourth , a bit more attention could have been given to the CGI work . In the first it was hard to tell that Shemp wasn't a real elephant ( except by behavior , of course ) , but here the CGI stands out like a sore thumb . Ideally special effects should merely tell the story whether they 're good or bad , and they at least do succeed on that count , so it 's a relatively small problem , but it 's still there . All that said , Christopher Showerman 's performance as George is decent enough . It lacks Brendan Fraser 's charm , but Christopher only really fails in that specific comparison - he even managed to give George a bit of personal depth , which should have been a major foul in a Jay Ward-inspired movie but wasn't here . Julie Benz as the new Ursula surprised me as being even better than Leslie Mann in the original . Most other performances were pretty standard , not standing out in my mind as either good or bad .  
  Annoying , static comedy with a painfully miscast Peter Sellers as a smarmy , self-centered Casanova who always has his way with the ladies . A major blemish on Sellers ' filmography , and , even worse , a film that seems to have been made solely to satisfy the ego of its star . ( * )  
  Let 's cut to the chase : this movie is softcore pornography marketed for the masses under a name that the studio is milking every last penny out of the American Pie teat . Period . The whole plot ( and that shouldn't imply that there 's a whole lot to go around ) serves as a vehicle to show the audience more boobs and sex scenes . If you 're a Tween guy , and you 're too squeamish to purchase actual pornography , then this is the movie for you . Otherwise , the movie doesn't have much to offer at all . The acting is sub-par , the character development is virtually non-existent , and the story is a nonsensical knarl of nudity , binge drinking and pranks ( none of which are particularly memorable ) . Go buy real porn if that 's what you want to see , and if not , go watch a GOOD movie . Animal House , Kids , or even the original American Pie are all great cinematic works , and all of them contain heavy alcohol use and nudity . " It 's not how much , it 's how you use it "  
  Although it 's an R rated movie , I really doubt that you 'll really enjoy it unless you 're a teenager Why ? Because there 's no real plot , no character development , no funny jokes . The only thing that this movie has plenty of is nudity . Tons and tons of naked or almost naked chicks ( pretty nice ones I might add ) to feast your eyes on . I really can't understand why this movie has the American Pie title since it 's only a bad combination between an erotic movie and a comedy without succeeding in being either of them . My suggestion is to watch this movie only if you want to see some naked chicks , but you 're too shy to rent / buy an erotic movie . Gave it 1/10 for the 2 smiles i had in the entire movie and another 2/10 for the nice chicks  
  I could not believe how awful this film was ; I rarely watch commercial TV , but thought " Well , Diane Keaton is always worth watching " . I stand corrected . Everyone involved should be hanging their heads in shame . I realize there are not a lot of great roles for women of a certain age , but the script to this was so inept , clichéd and baffling that I am surprised it ever got into development or that Ms . Keaton thought she could make a silk purse out of this sow 's ear . None of the characters had a shred of believability and were so incredibly unlikeable . The acting looked like exercises in a BEGINNING class - I stared in open-mouthed horror through most of this wondering " What were they thinking ? " . Very , very sad that it has come to this . Don't waste your time .  
  A very good story for a film which if done properly would be quite interesting , but where the hell is the ending to this film ? In fact , what is the point of it ? The scenes zip through so quick that you felt you were not part of the film emotionally , and the feeling of being detached from understanding the storyline . The performances of the cast are questionable , if not believable . Did I miss the conclusion somewhere in the film ? I guess we have to wait for the sequel .  
  Although the lead actress is STRIKINGLY beautiful , the plot stands little chance of acceptance because too many distracting details face the audience during the unfolding of the story . One may believe that middle-class teen-age school girls in the 1950 's easily gave away their virginity without thought of marriage to 30-year-old 's they barely know , but I doubt it . One may believe that young high school teens are highly self-confident and self-assured as they interact with their elders in complex social situations , but my experience has been , more often than not , teenagers feel very awkward and act clumsy as they experiment in the adult world . One may believe that a experienced medical doctor would not know the pungent oder of Stroptomycin - the smelly fermenting byproduct of busy earth microbes - and not detect that some lifeless bland powder is fake , but I think not . One may believe that 30-something-year-old troublemakers can enter into , and hang around inside , a public school rec hall during a school social and make trouble , but I think that school socials are traditionally a protected environment and parents , chaparones and school staff would be around to prevent this . One final nit , throughout Hey Babu Riba the five teenage friends referred to themselves as the foursome . There is probably an explanation why the FIVE were the FOURsome , but because it was never detailed , each reference distracts from each scene . This movie did not ring true for me .  
  The only way to get anything out of this film is to approach it as a comedy . Seen in that light , it does deliver . If you 're looking for a serious movie , look somewhere else . This film has absolutely no depth and offers little more than a cursory and one dimensional examination of " issues " with no insight whatsoever . Making a movie about stereotypes and then making every single character in your movie a stereotype is an extremely poor strategy - especially when those same characters only break their hackneyed molds in predictable , stereotypical ways . Busta Rhymes and Ice Cube make the film almost watchable , and Michael Rappaport turns in a good performance , but the script is so awful and the social commentary is so trite , it 's hard to find anything redeeming .  
  When ' My Deja Vu , My Deja Vu ' aired last season , I was pleased . Scrubs , I thought , is doing something clever and unique in regards to the clip-show concept . Instead of replaying footage , they 're replaying jokes in a self-aware manner , and I really enjoyed it . I found it really unfortunate that I was wrong . One season later , they succumbed to that which almost all sitcoms inevitably do , the clip show .. and it looked like it was put together by the work-experience kid . Dr Cox 's shaved head shows just how lazy the editors were in putting it together , as it doesn't appear again until ' My Long Goodbye ' some 4 episodes later . I can't imagine that a wig is too much effort when it comes to maintaining the continuity of what was once a well-constructed sitcom . Who knows why it was slotted there , it just seemed lazy and out of place , reminding me ( largely ) of episodes that have aired within the past year . Three second clips jammed together with background music is a DVD extra for a ( very ) rainy day , not an episode of prime-time television .  
  Spoiler ! I love Branagh , love Helena Bonham-Carter , loved them together in " Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein " - but THIS - I can understand an actor 's desire to stretch , to avoid the romantic stereotype . Well , they did , but really - the script droned on , Bonham-Carter 's clothes were tres chic , and the occasional speeded-up " madcap " sequence could have been an outtake from a Beatles ' movie , or the old Rowan and Martin Laugh-In . I never got the point - other commenters say the Branagh character was a dreamer . I never felt that . He was a loser , and not very bright , and certainly not endearing . The business with the bank robber disguise was merely painful to watch . Certainly not amusing . Bonham-Carter 's realistic ( one supposes ) attempts as realistic speech were harder to understand than the first 15 minutes of Lancashire accent in " Full Monty . " The poetic ending , with him high on a hill with her buried under the monstrosity of his airplane was too orchestrated . Was there a choir of angels , or merely a soundtrack ? Go back to the classics or something with a spine and an arc to it . Donate this to PBS .  
  I knew it would be , but I gave it a rent for some laughs and maybe some mindless fun . Anyone whose read a few of my reviews can see that I 'm pretty easy to please . I really didn't think I 'd end up feeling this negatively towards it . The plot is about an ancient army of dragons lead by a huge serpent that will destroy the world unless some chosen heroes who inherited the responsibility can become one with a good dragon or something I don't know . It was so stupid , I didn't bother to put much effort into retaining it . It features a really dumb story full of ridiculous moments and goofy concepts . So many of the events just felt totally random and sudden . I assume there was studio interference or something because the biggest problem I have with the movie is the fact that the story seems like it 's trying to be so grand and epic , yet everything happens so fast and goes by so quickly . I feel like I 've just been hit with a million plot points and action sequences in one big ball . The film is like a punch in the face . It doesn't take much time at all to establish characters or drama . Imagine the " Lord of the Rings " trilogy in 90 minutes You could have most of the epic battle sequences , but there would be absolutely no buildup and you 'd hardly care about the outcome of those battles . That was the case with Dragon Wars 90 minutes of me not giving a crap , waiting for it to be over . Fantastic CGI with some okay directing , but horrible acting , speedy pacing , and dumb story made this very hard to enjoy on any grounds . I probably would have loved it when I was 6 .  
  THE KING MAKER will doubtless be a success in Thailand where the similar ( but superior ) ' The Legend of Suriyothai ' set box office records . The film directed by Lek Kitaparaporn after a screenplay by Sean Casey based on historical fact in 1547 Siam has some amazingly beautiful visual elements but is disarmed by one of the corniest , pedestrian scripts and story development on film . The event the picture relates is the arrival of the Portuguese soldier of fortune Fernando de Gamma ( Gary Stretch ) whose vengeance for this father 's murderer drives him to shipwrecked , captured and thrown into slavery and put on the bloc in Ayutthaya in the kingdom of Siam where he is purchased by the beautiful Maria ( Cindy Burbridge ) with the consent of her father Phillipe ( John Rhys-Davies ) , a man with a name and a past that are revealed as the story progresses . There is a plot to overthrown the King and Fernando and his new Siamese sidekick Tong ( Dom Hetrakul ) , after some gratuitous CGI enhanced choreographed martial arts silliness , are first rewarded by the King to become his bodyguards , only to be imprisoned together once Queen Sudachan ( Yoe Hassadeevichit ) reveals her plot to kill the king and son to allow her lover Lord Chakkraphat ( Oliver Pupart ) to take over the rule of Siam . Yet of course Fernando and Tong escape and are condemned to fight each other to save the lives of their families ( Tong 's wife and children and Fernando 's now firm love affair with Maria ) with the expected consequences . The acting ( with the exception of John Rhys-Davies ) is so weak that the film occasionally seems as though it were meant to be camp . The predominantly Thai cast struggle with the poorly written dialog , making us wish they had used their native Thai with subtitles . The musical score by Ian Livingstone sounds as though exhumed form old TV soap operas . But if it is visual splendor you 're after there is plenty of that and that alone makes the movie worth watching . It is a film that has obvious high financial backing for all the special effects and masses of cast and sets and shows its good intentions . It is just the basics that are missing . Grady Harp  
  I 'm trying to picture the pitch for Dark Angel . " I 'm thinking Matrix , I 'm thinking Bladerunner , I 'm thinking that chick that plays Faith in Angel , wearing shiny black leather - or some chick just like her , leave that one with us . Only - get this ! - we 'll do it without any plot , dialogue , character , decent action or budget , just some loud bangs and a hot chick in shiny black leather straddling a big throbbing bike . Fanboys dig loud bangs and hot chicks in shiny black leather straddling big throbbing bikes , right ? " Flashy , shallow , dreary , formulaic , passionless , tedious , dull , dumb , humourless , desultory , barely competent . Live action anime without any action , or indeed any life . SF just the way Joe Fanboy likes it , in fact . : (  
  Wow , here it finally is ; the action " movie " without action . In a real low-budget setting ( don't miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times ) of a future Seattle we find a no-brain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhood . There is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors ' performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies , mainly " Matrix " without having the money to do it right . Yes , we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot-outs ( 45 secs approx . ) but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody 's attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then . And , yes , we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere , as if the script was thought-out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes . Believe me , it is as bad as it possibly can get . In fact , it doesn't deserve to be taken seriously , but perhaps I can make some of you not rent it and save your money .  
  I saw this film recently in a film festival . It 's the romance of an ex-alcoholic unemployed man who just came out of a big depression and a single middle-aged woman who works in an employment office ( INEM ) . I found the story very simple and full of clichés , taking the ' social ' theme of the movie and turn it in to a romance comedy . The lead actor did a good job , he definitely looks like an alcoholic man , but Ana Belen is not believable as a working class woman , she looks , acts and talks very much like a ' high-standing ' woman . What I mean is that Ana Belen plays herself . She does it in all her movies anyway . The whole mise-en-scene of the film was very poor . The photography is ugly , not using well at all the panoramic aspect ratio . The dialogue sounds totally scripted and dull most of the times . The comic situations are typical from Gomez Pereira , but in this case they are not funny at all and are resolved poorly . In my opinion this film is not worth watching . Only if you really love Pereira 's previous films you might enjoy this one a little bit . Anyway , I walked out of the theater because I felt I was wasting my time . The film-maker was by the door . I wonder what a director feels like when he sees someone walking out of one of his films , specially one that is made to please everybody .  
  This is simply the worst movie I 've ever seen . Neither of the three central characters has any charm , and Erika 's good looks aren't enough to carry the film . The lamest plot I 've ever had inflicted upon me . Also the most unconvincing military comedy ever . Why did they bother ?  
  As an Altman fan , I 'd sought out this movie for years , thinking that with such a great cast , it would have to be at least marginally brilliant . Big mistake . This is one of Altman 's big-cast mishmashes , thrown together haphazardly and improvisationally ( or so it feels ) with the hope that it would all come together in the editing room . It doesn't . As Maltin points out , this turkey is notable only for the debut performance of Alfre Woodard , who outshines the vets all around her . But other than that , avoid at all costs . ( Which is pretty easy to do - it 's never been released on video - to my knowledge - and its cable appearances have the frequency of Halley 's Comet . )  
  I 'm a nice guy , and I like to think of myself as genre-tolerant . And , I guess by that , I mean I try to consider a movie in the context of the genre that it resides in . If nothing else , that saves me from feeling like I should be saying really nasty things about people or films , which I don't like doing . The plot in this one was patently obvious , the production values very low and sets , uhm , simplistic . The acting rose into " good for a high school play " territory from time to time . My feeling was this was filmed in a day - please tell me it was . Worst of all , the sex , while reasonably plentiful , was fairly mundane , hampered by , at least in my copy , a " sound-over " that was inconsistent with the action ( climatic moans and shrieks while lying on a bed undoing a bra ? ) . There was definitely no " edge " to it at all-nothing distinguishing or interesting , and with surprisingly quick cuts . My vote is a " 1 " then , with the following summary statement : would have been better if the filler stripper material at the club was expanded , and the rest of the movie condensed .  
  Ohh man ! Now this is what I 'm talking about ! As far as bad / cheesy horror flicks go this movie was truly in a class of its own . A real gem ! First off , the film wasn't originally in English . That 's okay because the voice dubbing was truly exceptional ! Here is my favorite excerpt from the dialog ( and there is plenty more where this came from )  " I 'm feeling a little better . I 'm just thirsty FOR YOUR BLOOD ! " And what drama ! Here is a play by play recap of the interaction between the military and scientists Scene 1 Scientist : " You can't do that It 'll be a disaster ! " - Military Officer : " That 's just science fiction " ( he then proceeds to cause a complete disaster just like the scientist predicted ) . Scene 2 Scientist : " If you do that many people will die ! " - Military Officer : " you don't know what you 're talking about . " ( he does it and many people die ) . Scene 3 Scientist : " Don't do that It 'll kill everyone ! " - Military Officer : " That 's nonsense " ( he then proceeds to kill everyone ) Scene 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ( you get the idea ) . If that wasn't enough there were a few scenes that really stood out as instant classics ! In one scene , the military has literally 10 guys pointing guns at two unarmed men . The leader yells , " Go get ' em ! " and all 10 army guys , one at a time , drop their guns and fist fight the two adversaries ! Instant classic ! And don't worry . No attention to detail was left out ! This movie even had a hip / upbeat ' 80 's keyboard / synth soundtrack to set the mood ! And trust me I realize this review might contain some spoilers , but there are so many goodies in this epic I really only scratched the surface . A movie of this caliber only comes out once a decade ! A true movie watching experience ! A masterpiece ! Wow !  
  I thought that Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 was quite a good horror film When a terrorist 's body , infected with a stolen chemical , is recovered by the US military , the corpse is then cremated , releasing the virus into the atmosphere over a small island . Soon the infected locals turn into flesh-hungry zombies , and a group of soldiers on leave must team up with a group of tourists and board themselves up in a abandoned hotel as they try to fight off the aggressive living dead . I did not find this film to be as good as the original film , Zombie Flesh Eaters . But it was still an OK horror film with some good action . I did not think that it was one of the best in the series . 4/10  
  I am , as many are , a fan of Tony Scott films . When this movie came out I had high hopes that it would be like ' Man On Fire ' . To find out that the movie it 's the furthest thing from it ! The story was treading water from the get go , and the choice of Mickey Rourke was not such such a good idea . And the whole ' arm'scene was too gratuitous ! The movie is centered around Kiera Kinghtly , and this movie reveals that she 'll never become a movie star ! The movie brought some of the worst acting ever . I like Tony Scott 's direction ' n all , but this takes the whole friggin cake ! Sorry Ton , 1 out of 10 !  
  Yes I have rated this film as one star awful . Yet , it will be in my rotation of Christmas movies henceforth . This truly is so bad it 's good . This is another K.Gordon Murray production ( read : buys a really cheap / bad Mexican movie , spends zero money getting it dubbed into English and releases it at kiddie matinées in the mid 1960 's . ) It 's a shame I stumbled on this so late in life as I 'm sure some " mood enhancers " would make this an even better experience . I 'm not going to rehash what so many of the other reviewers have already said , a Christmas movie with Merlin , the Devil , mechanical wind-up reindeer and some of the most pathetic child actors I have ever seen bar none . I plan on running this over the holidays back to back with Kelsey Grammar 's " A Christmas Carol " . Truly a holiday experience made in Hell . Now if I can only find " To All A Goodnight ( aka Slayride ) " on DVD I 'll have a triple feature that can't be beat . You have to see this movie . It moves so slowly that I defy you not to touch the fast forward button-especially on the two dance routines ! This thing reeks like an expensive bleu cheese-guess you have to get past the stink to enjoy the experience . Feliz Navidad amigos !  
  This movie is supposed to be a " lighthearted " tale about Santa Claus and his " magical and mystical " wonders . But instead it comes off as being downright creepy . Two things in this movie that stand out in my mind as horrifying are 1 ) the way Santa looks . - Have you ever seen a more horrible looking Santa Claus ? and 2 ) the " evil rep . of Satan " Pitch 's just plain odd dances are just sickening to watch . Only watch this movie if it happens to be the MSTed version or if you like a very good laugh . I can't believe this is a children 's movie .  
  This Santa movie starts off strange and I think Santa might be a pedo . Instead of the usual elf toy makers , this Santa has apparently kidnapped kids from all across the globe and makes them sing a bit like characters from " It 's a Small World " ! I guess there are no child labor laws on the weird astral plane on which he lives ( it 's apparently NOT the North Pole and not on Earth ) ! None of these kids seem very happy and I kept wanting to see commandos break in and rescue the tykes , though I guess for some of the third world kids , these working conditions were perhaps an improvement over local sweatshops . I sure hope that all they do is sing and make toys . Then , the scene abruptly changes to Hell where lots and lots of demons dance about like they are in a Busby Berkeley musical . This fun in put to a stop by Satan who orders one of them , Pitch , to go to Earth to ruin Christmas ! Personally , I thought this movie already did that ! The Devil and his imps are actually kind of cute-like Hot Stuff from the Harvey Comics but with cool evil goatees ! Or , if you are Puerto Rican , like a vejigante mask with a goatee ! Somehow a poverty-stricken Mexican kid named Lupita , a group of jerky kids who want to mug Santa and some rich kid are key battlegrounds for the Devil and Santa ! So , if the Prince of Darkness ( not Donald Trump , it 's the OTHER Prince of Darkness ) can somehow make her steal and be bad , he 'll ' win'-what , we don't really know ! In fact , as they root her on , you get the impression that the film makers intend Santa to be Jesus-as he has all these great powers AND fights the Devil over kids ' souls ! Later , Santa meets with his friend , Merlin . He asks him to make him a special powder that makes people dream nice dreams . Considering how much Santa laughs in the film ( like a demented chipmunk ) , I assume he must use this drug A LOT ! He immediately goes to see a blacksmith who makes him a magic key that opens ALL doors . Considering he keeps kids as his personal ' assistants ' , this magic key thing worries me immensely ! During Santa 's Christmas Eve ride , you see Lupita behave like a little angel-one problem down . Santa then takes time out now to take care of the rich kid whose parents are selfish jerks . He gives them some sort of crazy cocktail which magically solves their problems-two problems solved . This is a rare case where alcohol / drugs HELP kids and solves problems ! And as for the little muggers , he gives them coal ! Frustrated with his losses to Santa , Pitch then tries to steal the sleigh ( which is pulled by creepy animatronic deer ) . When this fails , he destroys Santa 's stash of ' magic powder ' ! As a result , Santa can't become invisible to avoid dogs and gets treed . Uh , oh .. how can Santa take a detour to the Betty Ford Clinic if he 's stuck up a tree ? ! Will St . Nick get down from the tree and get the monkey off his back or will the devils win ? If you care , tune in and see . However , be warned that the film is bat-crap crazy ! Technically speaking , the film is yecchy . While it is in color , it 's really gaudy . The music is mostly done on an organ-which , along with bad singing from the kids , produces perhaps the worst soundtrack I 've heard in recent memory . And the story is just incomprehensible and very , very , very creepy . Devils and a Santa that kidnaps kids is just plain creep-tastic . It 's a film you should NEVER show to kids but makes a great film to watch with friends so you can laugh at it from start to finish !  
  This movie should not be viewed unless you are trying to kill yourself . I think this movie could actually cause severe brain damage . The main characters are the whiny non-hero Kevin , Amy , his bratty , ungodly conservative girlfriend , Kyle , a dork in red shorts who enjoys phone sex , Daphne , a scrawny , horny girl who is supposed to be " cool " and has no sense of how to dress , and her oversexed boyfriend Nick , an army recruit who can make an innuendo out of anything . No , I 'm not a pervert , that 's REALLY how the movie goes . The movie itself is an over-sexed rip-off of 1986 's Gremlins , only you 'll never find a trace of Gizmo anywhere . No , these Hobgoblins , unleashed by Wimpy Man ( I 'm sorry , Kevin ) , make someone 's wildest dreams come true , and then kill the victims . Yes , you guessed it-Eventually , they wind up in a strip club , where the nerdy Amy 's greatest dream is revealed-She wants to be a stripper ! Look , I watched this flick via MST3K , and even with Mike Nelson , Tom Servo , and Crow T . Robot making a laughing-stock out of this cinematic trainwreck and it still made me bleed from both eyes . Not really , but I wish I had . I 'm not giving you anymore plot , because reliving it gives me this great urge to drive a pitchfork through my brain . Besides , it 's not like there 's a plot worth mentioning . They should put a Surgeon 's General Warning on this film .  
  This movie wasn't awful but it wasn't very good . I am a big fan Toni Collette I think she is a very beautiful and talented actress . The movie starts off about Robin Williams who is a writer and gets a book from a 14 year old kid . The book is great and he cant't believe a kid wrote it . Toni Collette plays the kids guardian who you don't know if this kid really exists or if she 's making it all up . I am not gonna ruin the movie but I will say this the movie is not scary . The acting is pretty good and Toni Collette 's performance was awesome as well as Robin Williams . The movie was a huge disappointment in my opinion I would wait for it to come to DVD .  
  .. from this awful movie ! There are so many things wrong with this film , acting , writing , direction , editing , etc . that it 's amazing that something rises to the top and proves itself to be the absolute worst . The music ! I noted that the film has two composers listed . This must be the reason why every single frame has music , of the absolute worst " D " movie style drivel . They have never heard of the expression " less is more " . It got so painful to listen to , I muted the sound every time there was no dialogue , not that the dialogue was that good . You have to feel sorry for Robert Wagner and Tom Bosley , I 'm sure they didn't see roles like this in the twilight of their careers . See it at your own risk .  
  I came into this movie really wanting to line it . I thought the premise had a lot of potential and was ripe for an interesting movie . Don't get me wrong here , I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane , I was taking this for the B movie that it is . That said , it still fell short of the expectation . The historical aspect of the story is glazed over and the ending left me a bit cold . The acting in the movie was very wooden . All in all I give it 4 for a great idea , but the movie could have scored much higher with a bit more attention to movie making fundamentals . Is it worth seeing ? I didn't wish for my two hours back , but I don't know that I 'd recommend it to others .  
  The Fallen Ones starts with archaeologist Matt Fletcher ( Casper Van Dien ) in the desert discovering the mummified remains of a 42 foot tall giant , now there 's something you don't see everyday . Matt is working for property developer Morton ( Robert Wagner ) who wants to build a holiday resort on the land & he calls in fellow archaeologist Angela ( Kristen Miller ) for reasons I 'm unsure of . Anyway they both try to figure out what they 've got on they 're hands when some of the team go missing , Morton calls in security guy Ammon ( Navid Negahban ) to handle the situation . Meanwhile ancient text translator the Rabbi Eli Schmidtt ( Tom Bosley ) translates some ancient text ( as he would ) & is shocked to learn of a evil prophecy in which these giants will rise up & take over the world for the Fallen One , or something like that . It 's up to Matt to save the day & the whole planet .. Written & directed by Kevin VanHook , who also has a small role in the film as the ancient warrior leader at the start , I personally thought The Fallen Ones was a terrible film & it 's as simple & straight forward as that . There are so many things that are just plain bad about The Fallen Ones both on a technical & conceptual level , the script doesn't make a whole lot of sense & it doesn't really get going until the final 20 odd minutes by which time I had almost lost the will to live . The character 's are awful & as clichéd as you like , the dialogue is bad as in very , very bad & the entire film is predictable , I mean it 's not going to come as a surprise that Casper Van Dien is going to save the day is it ? It 's not a huge surprise that the mummified giant is going to come back to life either so why wait until over an hour into the film when most of the audience will be in some sort of comatose state . This is bad , very bad . You have been warned . Director VanHook doesn't impress , the fight scenes are absolutely awful & why dress your bad guys up in a horrible shade of purple ? They look naff . To give it a bit of credit the special effects on the giant Mummy itself are actually good although there 's not that many of them since he doesn't make an appearance for over an hour , there are also some normal sized Mummy 's that look to have come straight from the set of The Mummy ( 1999 ) , unfortunately these aren't used to any great effect & in fact are wasted as some comic relief . The mechanical Mummy was a pretty good idea but looked silly & there is no way on Earth that all those people inside could work in sync with each other to operate it , actually the more I think about the more ridiculous the idea is . Forget about any scares , tension or atmosphere & don't even think about any gore or violence because there isn't any . Technically The Fallen Ones isn't anything special & apart from the impressive giant Mummy effects there 's little her to get excited about . The ghost CGI & water effects are terrible , it was made-for-TV & it 's shows . The acting was poor , Wagner looks embarrassed & this is probably the only thing the likes of Dien & Bosley can get these days . The Fallen Ones is a bad film , there 's no two ways about it as far as I 'm concerned . Not recommended on any level or in any way , one to avoid .  
  Essentially a story of man versus nature , this film has beautiful cinematography , the lush jungles of Ceylon and the presence of Elizabeth Taylor but the film really never gets going . Newlwed Taylor is ignored and neglected by her husband and later is drawn to the plantation 's foreman , played by Dana Andrews . The plantation is under the spell of owner Peter Finch 's late father whose ghost casts a pall over Elephant Walk that becomes a major point of contention between Taylor and Finch . The elephants are determined to reclaim their traditional path to water that was blocked when the mansion was built across their right-of-way . The beasts go on a rampage and provides the best moments of action in the picture . Taylor and Andrews have some good moments as she struggles to remain a faithful wife in spite of he marital difficulties with Finch .  
  Much of " Over Her Dead Body " is so painfully unfunny that I was actually squirming in my seat out of embarrassment for the actors . Eva Longoria proves that she can't carry a film in this terrible romantic comedy , and further , that she doesn't really even have any comedic timing . She 's grating and annoying as a ghost who returns to earth to keep a cooky psychic from dating her widower fiancé . The fiancé is played by Paul Rudd , drippy and charmless , while the psychic is played by Lake Bell , bringing the movie whatever anemic energy it has . I felt most sorry for Bell , as she appears to have some comic abilities and was working overtime in an effort to make the material work . Unfortunately , she is up against the insurmountable task of making any movie that features Jason Biggs tolerable , and she is dragged down with the rest of the cast like Leo DiCaprio at the end of " Titanic . " " Over Her Dead Body " actually pi * ed me off , because of its laziness and utter lack of effort . I started to think of all the interesting projects that can't get funded because vast amounts of money are being funneled into bland crap like this . Seriously , does Hollywood think movies like this are good enough ? How stupid do they really think the movie-going public is ? Grade : F  
  Well this is the first post am ever commenting on IMDb . , do you get it , this movie has made me come and warn all the good souls who will stop ever experimenting with movies . As most of them have given their comments I thought of watching this movie because it seemed to have some decent actors ( though having read worst critics against this movie ) I thought of experimenting it assuming it to be some comedy flick . , Well it all started well with some ahem . , comedies .. then it all started going pathetic .. man you can believe your self , you wud feel like going and banging your head each and every time the pathetic looking woman called the heroine of the movie is made helpless .. Huh ~ ~ Well how much can a person digest a sick all POSSESSIVE witch kinda ghost trying to do all she can to irritate you and stop you from what you are doing . The next worst thing about the movie is , the " ZOMBIE " Hero , yes as he looses his fiancé he roams around like a Goat , with black marks under his eyes . , and with the hero 's " terribly stupid " sister .. you wud be bleeding from head to toe if you attempted and succeeded by completely watching this movie ~ !  
  I was very disappointed in this 1970 film based on a Bernard Malamud story . This is basically a story of possible redemption , racial bias and the unfulfillment of life based on mistrust . A black Jewish angel is sent to help a struggling tailor and his critically ill wife . If Morris Mishkin ( Zero Mostel ) will only believe in the angel ( Belafonte ) , his wife Fanny ( Ida Kaminska ) will recover . The problem is that Morris has basically given up on life and just refuses to believe that Belafonte is an angel . When he believes it , Fanny improves but in the end he has doubts and Fanny suffers accordingly . It would have been very nice if there had been an English translation in the last scene when a dying Fanny speaks to Morris . Jan Kadar , who successfully directed Miss Kaminska in her Oscar nominated brilliant performance in 1966 's " The Shop on Main Street " directs this film as well . Kaminska is reduced in the film to mostly bed scenes and her kindness in her speech really doesn't convey the desperate situation that she faces . She keeps calling for Ruthie , their daughter , who disobeyed them by marrying out of the Jewish religion . For most of the film , she does not realize the Angel 's appearance in her apartment . The scene in the pharmacy is muddled and the scene where the Angel 's girl friend confronts Belafonte in their apartment , is memorable but all too brief . We don't know why Belafonte is in danger and why he has died . Those viewing this film must have left the theater in a state of depression and desperation .  
  I was seriously looking forward to seeing this film because it seemed truly promising from the coming attractions : Jim Carrey with Godlike powers was an idea that most definitely worked for me . As a huge fan , I was sure he 'd be supremely in his element with such a promising premise , and what could go wrong ? Yesterday , my bubble got burst big-time , boys and girls , because I saw the movie . The first act ( where it 's set up that he hates his life , he 's a disgruntled employee and a majorly unhappy camper with an ax to grind against God ) is serviceable , the second act ( where he 's summoned by God via telephone and receives Powers Almighty ) is GREAT - Carrey gets to have fun with his new ' toys ' and it 's a pleasure to watch , really funny . But the third act is wretched beyond belief . The rot starts setting in after the dinner scene between Bruce and his girlfriend Grace ( Jennifer Aniston , who comes off EXCEEDINGLY well in this movie considering her part is merely a plot device ; even her NAME reeks of unsubtlety ) - she thinks he 's gonna pop ' the question ' but instead , he tells her ( on bended knee , yet ) that he 's finally getting his news anchor job , and isn't it so exciting ? She doesn't think so . She wants him to marry her , see , so she winds up leaving him , see , even though she still LOVES him very much , see , and the rest of the film is spent banging us over the head with one pathetic , beyond-heavy-handed spiritual-sounding cliche after the next , until by the end I was praying , too . . . for it to be over . I didn't mind the lack of subtlety in the first two acts ( one example - in the 2nd act , after he gets his powers , Bruce prances into the room singing " What if God were one of us , just a slob like one of us " , blah blah blah ) , and I was even willing to overlook the amazing amount of contradictions being hurled at us ( for openers , Morgan Freeman - a / k / a GOD - tells Bruce he can't violate anyone 's free will but he does this , a lot ) . Those choices were forgivable - this is a Jim Carrey comedy , directed by Tom Shadyac - it aint The Remains of the Day . Or rather it was SUPPOSED to be a comedy . When the script writers lose track of that ( in the dreaded act 3 ) and try to turn the proceedings into some sort of ( gag ) Message Movie , what we get instead is hell on earth . Bruce realizes the error of his selfish ways , he realizes that GRACE is his saving - have to say it - grace , and that his priorities in life had been severely misconstrued . All this could have been conveyed in a far less heavy-handed way , however . The film didn't have to go into the dumper to make these points . Unfortunately , the writers and Shadyac apparently had no idea how to resolve the story in any sort of clever , light-handed way , so they went the bang 'em over the heads route in hopes that we wouldn't notice . They even tacked some surprisingly unfunny out-takes at the end , in the further hope that this would lessen the bad taste . It didn't work for me .  
  Usually , I know after the first minute of a movie if I will hate it or adore it .. but now , I was wrong . The start was great ; the " this is based on a true story " and blah blah blah thing was funny . After , the cartoons and the description of the guys ' life with pictures made me think I had made the right choice . Then , seeing the hilarious fake look of Toronto was cool . Also , the situation and appearance of the house seemed to confirm my first idea . That was maybe the first 10 minutes of the movie .. which afterwards looked like an eternity . Maybe that 's just me not understanding English Canadian humour ( that 's possible , English Canadians also do not always understand Quebecois humour ) , but hey .. there was enough stuff in that for a short movie , * nothing * more . Maybe that could be a meaning for the title ? Anyway , almost everything was filling , and very few things were even close to funny in my opinion . As a matter of fact , the " making of " was better than the movie . At least you understand the motivation behind that which made everything bad . The potential of the idea was great ; that 's why I rented the movie , being interested in the " annoying people disappearance " thing . But yet , I did not know the whole universe would vanish , and with it even a point to the movie . If you are English Canadian , it seems you could appreciate the local humour , considering the surprising number of people who gave this movie an 8 . Otherwise , just think twice before losing your precious time ..  
  Definitely one of funny man Eddie Murphy 's lesser films is this nonsense about a kidnapped mystical child , three hundred year old dragons and a " Chosen One " . Murphy is the " Chosen One " in question , and as the opening song suggests , he is " the best man in the world " . A finder of lost and missing children , he is approached by a mysterious Tibetan woman ( Charlotte Lewis ) who tells him he is " The Chosen One " , and that it is his destiny to find and rescue " The Golden Child " . For if the child were to die , compassion would die with him , as he is the bearer of compassion . If all this hocus pocus rubbish hasn't ruined it for you now , it surely will once the movie begins . Suffice to say the plot is abominable and destroys the whole film . Meant to be another vehicle for Murphy 's egotistical brand of humour ( the comedy isn't so great mind you ) , the movie fails on many levels . Even Charles Dance as the evil Sardo Numspa can't do much for proceedings . Very silly and disappointing . Sunday , December 12 , 1993 - T.V.  
  It seems that the intention of the film was to show the aggressive ( maffia-like ) character of Russians , or at least of those Russians able to travel outside their big country ; that it is too easy to rob a bank in England ; and that British police is so inefficient that it cannot find the person who robbed the bank even when these subjects are leaving the country by air . In addition , Nicole Kidman and the supposed Russian colleagues spoke a language not yet identified anywhere , probably spoken by Aliens in the Ural mountains , but far to be the Russian one . So Nicole , if you really want to talk Russian , kindly go to Moscow or St . Petersburg and keep yourself busy learning Russian language grammar and its pronunciation .  
  This film is self indulgent rubbish . Watch this film if you merely want to hear spoken Gaelic or enjoy the pleasant soundtrack . Watch for any other reason and you will be disappointed . It should be charming but isn't - it 's just irritating . The characters are difficult to care about and the acting is poor . The stories within the film are also charmless and sinister . I was expecting a heartwarming family film but this also held no appeal to my fourteen year old daughter . It is rarely that I cannot see a film through to its conclusion but this one got the better of both of us . Although the film is set in current times it has the look and feel of a cheap East European film made during the Cold War . There isn't even enough in the way of beautiful Scottish scenery and cinematography to redeem it . A real shame because as a film this is an embarrassment to Scotland .  
  Well , if it weren't for Ethel Waters and a 7-year-old Sammy Davis , Jr . ( here billed without the Jr . ) , Rufus Jones for President would be one of the worst representations of African-American stereotypes I 've seen from the early talkie era and wouldn't have been worth seeing because of that . Ms . Waters is excellent here singing " Am I Blue ? " and " Underneath Our Harlem Moon " while Mr . Davis shows us how his childhood experience in showbiz prepared him for his superstar status as an adult . He 's so good tap-dancing here that for awhile I thought he was a little person with decades of experience . So if you 're willing to ignore the negative connotations here , Rufus Jones for President should provide some good enjoyment . P.S. This marks the fourth time today I 've seen and heard the song , " I 'll Be Glad When You 're Dead You Rascal You " performed on film , this time by Davis . Must have been a very popular song about this time .  
  I rented this film purely on the fact that the cover appealed to me . However as soon as the film began I had regrets . It seems they used a home video camera to shoot this film and let a young child do it . They also used inappropriate ghostly faces and shapes to try and scare people but i found myself laughing , i could have put that together myself and done a better job of it . As for the plot I felt that it had some really good ideas but because of dodgy lines and in some cases acting they were overshadowed . It had no direction . I didn't want to sit through it all because it caused me physical pain to watch it but i always finish what i start so i took a deep breath and let it carry on . Definitely 98minutes of my life wasted . I would save yourself the embarrassment of knowing that you have watched ' Haunted Boat ' and find something that is more entertaining . I 'm a fan of low budget horror films but this was a major disappointment i thought nothing could get worse after ' Terror Toons ' but this made me reconsider . A let down to its genre . * out of * ( The star is for the ideas of having their worst fears coming for them )  
  Geez ! This is one of those movies that you think you previously reviewed but you didn't . I mean , you didn't give a crap about it but somehow it came to your mind . To be honest and brief ; this is one of the worst , boring , and stupid slashers ever made . I can't say anything good about this piece of crap because there are barely decent sequences that could tell it 's made by professional film makers . The death scenes are horrible , bloodless , stupid . The plot is somehow good taking in account that it copied " Popcorn " from 1991 . To make things even worse , this isn't a movie so bad that it 's good . It 's just plain bad . Molly Ringwald tried to do her best but it wasn't enough .  
  This film was made and cast from my home town . I remember the fuss about it and the whole hullabaloo about the fact Molly Ringwald was in town .. Storyline .. Essentially 20 years after a film was " laid to rest " without being finished , a group of film students set out to complete it - with dire consequences . It would seem someone does not want the film completed . The storyline is flimsy . One has to remember that this is a comedy and therefore has to be taken a little tounge in cheek , but it had no real oomph . The characters are mostly transperant and the little info that you recieve about them you just don't care about , it seems irrelevant . It is weird hearing Kylie 's accent as Australian again and nice to see a kid I went to school with in a starring role . But that doesn't redeem the film at all . Goodness knows why the makers thought they would get in Molly Ringwald . Perhaps due to the nature of the film ( it sort of pays homage to 80s films / bad horror films ) but really an Aussie actor would have done just fine . As far as casting is concerned a lot of the acting seemed constipated . Some of these kids ( especially the two main chics - they played " director " and " producer " ) looked like they were trying to act . That is never a good look . Also , the shots had a rough feel about them . Over lit perhaps ? Just not as smooth as one is used to . The killer . Lord . Could it be less frightening ? There are some shock factors though , and a couple of gross scenes . I did like the film , but it was not great . It went for 90 minutes but could have gone for less . Perhaps if they had tightened the script it would have been better . They had a lot of characters get killed - but no real build up to them getting slayed . Maybe if they had killed less people and actually concentrated on a scary atmosphere it would have been better . Now I know it is a comedy and elements were funny . Or so unbelieveable they were funny . But I am not convinced . LM .  
  I understand the jokes quite well , they just aren't good . The show is horrible . I understand it , and that 's another horrible thing about it . The only cool character there EVER was on the show was that one hobo in that one episode , but then I see the other episode including that episode and the show is horrible . It 's not funny , NOT funny ! I don't want people to say " Only smart people get it " because if they 're so smart why do they judge people they don't even know and say that they 're not smart or intellectual enough to understand it ? It 's like saying " The sky is red " but never looking outside . But anyways , this is absolutely the worst show I have ever seen in my life , the jokes are terrible , I mean , you can understand them , they 're just horrible , her controversy is very lame , her fart jokes and other jokes on bodily fluids are really dumb and usually consist of really bad acting . I 'm not sure what these " smart " people see in this show , but judging others when they don't even know anything about any of us isn't exactly a smart comment .  
  This film is a Pia Zadora special ! When viewing it , I was reminded of the classic cartoon showing a Hollywood starlet ; in urgent need of another role but afraid of becoming typecast for ' B ' movie or soft porn roles ; who says at her casting session " Well of course I do not normally do roles requiring nudity , but if it is artistically necessary for the film .. " . This recollection brought up a very naughty image of a similar cartoon showing Pia at such a session saying " Well of course I do not normally take any roles requiring actual acting , but if it will really give me sufficient exposure to enhance my status as a sex symbol .. " . This is probably grossly unfair , the rather sordid tale is the fault of Harold Robbins book ; considering the nature of the story Pia 's exposures certainly do not receive undue attention , and perhaps Pia ( who once won an acting award in Butterfly ) is deliberately satirising her part rather than attempting to act in an almost unplayable role . Critics usually point first to the actors as the problem whenever a film proves disappointing , but this is grossly unfair ; the scriptwriters and director are far more often the guilty parties . The real problem with " The Lonely Lady " is that the screenplay , like the original book , looks for sensation rather than substance , and nothing can help with this . The screenplay for this film is abysmal , but whether the story could have been filmed more successfully with a better script , tauter directing and really competent acting must remain a matter of personal judgement . As it was released , my viewers rating for it would depend upon whether I am assessing my personal opinion , or assessing to what extent the film succeeds in providing what it aims at doing . My personal rating for it would be two out of ten ; but to some extent this film probably provides exactly what its sponsors intended , and judged on this basis a quality rating of four out of ten would be reasonable . Being in a charitable mood , and wanting to make it clear that I am not blaming Pia for my disappointment , I will give an IMDb rating of four .  
  Basically there 's a family where a little boy ( Jake ) thinks there 's a zombie in his closet & his parents are fighting all the time . This movie is slower than a soap opera .. and suddenly , Jake decides to become Rambo and kill the zombie . OK , first of all when you 're going to make a film you must Decide if its a thriller or a drama ! As a drama the movie is watchable . Parents are divorcing & arguing like in real life . And then we have Jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film ! I expected to see a BOOGEYMAN similar movie , and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots . 3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents & descent dialogs . As for the shots with Jake : just ignore them .  
  N.B. : Spoilers within . Assigning an artistic director to an operatic production naturally and inevitably means you are going to get a piece of that director 's mind . But directing a Wagner opera is an especially tricky task , as he was perhaps the most explicit opera composer in terms of what things should look like and how they should unfold . Hans-Jurgen Syberberg loads this filming of " Parsifal , " Wagner 's final masterpiece , with enough extraneous ideas to cause it to nearly burst at the seams . You get more than a piece of the director : you get the whole fatted hog and then some . Syberberg is to be admired for his penchant for tearing back the covers on the uglier aspects of German history . But does it work to meld that desire to a Wagner opera already brimming with its own concepts ? The scenes with the knights of the Holy Grail in Acts I and II are especially laden with visual allegory and symbolism . These are drawn come from Wagner 's own time , from long before , and go well beyond . If you know what these things mean , they can enrich Syberberg 's vision for you ( but not necessarily enhance Wagner 's vision ) ; if you don't know what they mean , they 're simply confusing , if not annoying . I won't bother uncoiling the plot of the opera here . Suffice it to say it is a typical Wagnerian synthesis of diverse elements , in this case a blending of the Holy Grail legend with the principles , practices , and pageantry of Christianity . The theme of redemption plays the main role here , as in nearly every Wagner opera . I personally had to sweat to get through Syberberg 's first act ( amidst my jarring acclimation , the music saved the day ) . But Act II picks up the pace . Here we meet Klingsor , the evil sorcerer , out to entrap the wandering " innocent fool " Parsifal . The greatest seductress of them all , Kundry , will be used to entice him to the dark side . After an initial dalliance with more symbols , these get stripped away , and the long , gorgeous , transformational duet between young fool and temptress really takes off . Finally the film starts working a genuine magic , and it is chiefly due to Syberberg 's choosing to set things naturally and simply . Suddenly the acting starts to work ( the expressive actress Edith Clever and the luscious soprano of Yvonne Minton team to create a wondrous Kundry ) ; suddenly the music seems to come to life and make vivid the inner turmoil of the two characters . The camera work stays simple and quietly fluid . In other words , Wagner is allowed to tell his story more on his own terms . And it works beautifully . For me it was the most engrossing part of the film . With the re-entrance of the knights in part 2 of Act II , the weird extraneous symbolisms unfortunately creep back in . Some other loony Syberberg ideas : using a huge Wagner death-mask as a major set-piece ( causing the composer 's protuberant proboscis to loom comically large ) ; dressing the Act II knights in all manner of costumes , wigs , and makeup ( what is the director saying ? That the knights are a bunch of buffoons ? That they express multiple or timeless layers of significance beyond their surface functions ? It 's anybody 's guess ) ; the insertion  just after the incredibly touching baptism of Kundry by Parsifal  of rear-projection footage of the conductor rehearsing , in modern-day realism , his orchestra in the studio ( this completely snapped my dramatic thread , requiring a few minutes to regroup ) ; the complete avoidance of having any time pass between Acts II and II ( when we meet the knight and " narrator " Gurnemanz again , he should be an old , old man , and Parsifal should re-emerge as a world-weary but wiser middle-aged man ) ; but certainly the most bizarre stroke is to split the Parsifal character into male / female components . Some find this the most brilliant stroke . No doubt I can credit Karin Krick , who plays " Parsifal 2 , " with acting of strength and dignity ( she also happens to be the best lip-syncher of the whole cast ) . But please .. Wagner 's conception of Parsifal is already so complex . His growth from a completely innocent boy who knows nothing of his past , to his breakthrough realization in Act II of what Amfortas 's eternal wound means and how it has become his own , to his return as the great Redeemer of Act II  this is the journey of a masterfully constructed character . The bi-sexual emphasis is just gimmicky and absurd . ( And what 's with this nonsense about a homoerotic Gurnemanz and Parsifal ? Can't we just accept a mentor / apprentice relationship , which is marvelously reversed in Act II ? ) The Monte Carlo Philharmonic under Armin Jordan plays with passion and beauty ( though the chorus is disappointing ) . But after watching this film I only wanted to whip out my Solti-led recording ( HIGHLY recommended ) and get my Wagnerian bearings straight again . The film experience for me ranged from bizarre to entertaining to infuriating . To Syberberg 's credit , he 's created a visually arresting work , and he certainly offers a unique take on an important opera . But instead of sticking to " Parsifal , " he seems to have wanted to bring in all things Wagnerian : the man , the life , the enormous influence .. all of it in crude symbolic code . " Parsifal " the opera is already full of weighty symbolism : the Grail , the Spear , the Holy Sacraments , baptism , Amfortas 's ever-bleeding wound , Klingsor 's self-castration , the Kiss , Kundry 's Curse , and on and on . This is not to mention the * musical * symbolism sounding constantly in the score , in the form of Wagner 's leitmotif system . " Parsifal " itself is one huge symbol ! Getting back to my first-paragraph question , Syberberg 's whole hog is all way too much for me . But if this project sounds like something to tickle your fancy , then go for it . I won't recommend just staying away from this ; you may find yourself heartily satisfied . Or if you need something to crack your Wagner barrier , try it .. but please , please , don't stop here . " Parsifal " is in a late , very ripe league of its own .  
  In 17th Century Japan , there lived a samurai who would set the standard for the ages . His name was Mayeda . He is sent on an epic journey across the world to acquire 5,000 muscats from the King of Spain . Whilst at sea a violent storm swallows their precious gold intended to buy the weapons and almost takes their lives . Mayeda must battle all odds to survive and the secure the fate of his beloved Japan . Shogun Mayeda is a multi million dollar action adventure epic set across three continents . Starring cinema legends Sho Kosugi ( Tenchu : Stealth Assassins ) , Christopher Lee ( Star Wars , Lord of the Rings Trilogy ) , John Rhys Davies ( Lord of the Rings Trilogy , Indiana Jones Trilogy ) and Toshiro Milfune ( The Seven Samurai , Throne of Blood ) , Shogun Mayeda ( Kabuto ) is a film masterpiece . The Osaka winning stunt team bought to the screen by Bob Ivy bring exciting battle / action sequences such as the opening battle against the Eastern army , the attack on Mayeda 's ship carrying priceless jewels and the final confrontation between Sho Kosugi and David Essex . A fine musical score by famed composer John Scott is also present . Director Sho Kusugi was not even nominated for an Oscar for this film which deals with the emotional strife such as the death of Mayedas family , the search for love and acceptance after grieving , all of which is dealt with extremely well . Highly recommended cinematic masterpiece . Please note : All of the above is opposite for the film in question .  
  Whoever made this nonsense completely missed the point . Jane is a silly comic strip to titillate without being sleazy . This giant mess tries to be funny and exciting but is just a shambles . There is not one decent performance in it .. even the usually reliable Jasper Carrott is painfully unfunny . The American bloke whose name escapes me is just as rubbiush as he was in flash gordon . Maud Adams tries as a villianess but she is a bit long in the tooth for this type of thing . All of these things would not matter if the girl was sexy or funny or likable . She is not . Kirsten Holmes faded into obscurity after this and so much the better . I 've flushed more entertaining things than this down the toilet . Avoid  
  " While traveling in the mountains , a man is attached by a mysterious creature that promptly departs , leaving no trace of its presence . Unbeknownst to the man , he has been attacked by a werewolf and now he 's inherited the curse associated with such creatures . Now our hero must race against time to rid himself of this dreadful affliction before the next full moon , " according to the DVD sleeve 's synopsis . Horrifically re-produced from the original Spanish , " The Fury of the Wolf Man " loses whatever charms it may have possessed in its original form . Lycanthropic Paul Naschy 's werewolf characterization is uneven and ineffectual . Dominatrix scientist Perla Cristal and sexy assistant Verónica Luján never get close enough to truly titillate . The often incoherent storyline isn't even ghoulishly amusing .  
  I had not seen the movie trailer when I went to see the movie , instead I based my judgments on a friend 's opinions . Now I like Chris Rock and his comedy , but this movie just falls flat on its face . During the movie Rock delivers a couple of funny jokes , but unfortunately the movie is sorely lacking in comedy . The movie seems want to integrate both laughter and love into one , and it that endeavor it fails . The love story in the movie is straight forward ( luckily ) , but it detracts too much from the movie by making Rock serious and bland . After all , the movie is first and foremost destined to be a comedy , where laughter should be the primary concern . Not much of that in the movie . The plot is also pretty uninteresting as a whole . Some parts were discontinuous altogether . If the supporting cast were meant to be funny , they certainly didn't do a good job . The couple of angels from heaven tried to make a couple of jokes , which were dry and dull . Rock 's first incarnation 's couple of underlings were also bland . If there 's one thing they did do right , though , they made Rock seem funnier by comparison .  
  I remember being forced ( yes-literally FORCED ) to see this film by a Southern Baptist Preacher when I was a kid , and even then I loved its awfulness . It 's designed to scare poor suckers into being " saved . " The only thing that " saved " me was the fact that it finally ended and I could go out and have a REAL life . Check out the chapter on this film in Sarah Diamond 's book " The Politics of the Christian Right . " FASCINATING . And certainly more interesting than the movie !  
  First off there is nothing wrong with studying Daniel , Revelation , Matthew 24 , Isaiah and other prophetic scriptures . There is also nothing wrong with making a film such as this to attempt to present the gospel message . So my qualms with this movie are not in either its sincerity or aspirations . As a Christian , though an amillenialist , I believe there will be a great tribulation and I believe Christ will return as he said as much . So even though I have disagreement with this film about the rapture that is not why I rate this movie so low . No , what makes me rate this movie so low is not its sincerity or its message , but rather its lack of production values , awful script , mediocre acting , and pitiful FX . This movie ranks down there with some of the cheesiest scifi fodder of the 1950s . No , this movie ranks down there with Plan 9 From Outerspace . This movie failed to age well and was probably dated by the time they made a sequel . The apocalypse genre film producers could have learned how not to make an end times film from this , but they failed . The Left Behind Series , The Apocalypse series , and the Omega Code series all failed to learn from this because they addressed the FX problems and the dated look problem , but their scripts are still poor , and their acting is wooden . There are great Christian films , with extremely low budgets , but this film is not one of them . I 'm surprised the MST3K crew never lampooned this one .  
  I don't really post comments , but wanted to make sure to warn people off this film . It 's an unfinished student film with no redeeming features whatsoever . On a technical level , it 's completely amateur - constant unintentional jump edits within scenes , dubbing wildly off , etc . The plot is completely clichéd , the structure is laughable , and the acting is embarrassing . I don't want to be too harsh : I 've made my share of student films , and they were all awful , but there 's no reason for this film to be out in the world where innocent fans will have to see it . Safe assumption that - much like the cast - positive comments are filmmakers , friends , and family .  
  WARNING ! This review will reveal the ending of the movie , " Scoop . " If you don't want to know how the movie ends , don't read this review ! " Scoop " is so bad you 'll think " Annie Hall " was a fluke . It gets one star because you get to see Hugh Jackman 's naked chest . That 's the only thing " Scoop " has going for it . Woody Allen 's misogyny , and his fixation on women young enough , at this point , to be his granddaughter , has crippled any ability to make movies he may have had at any point . The plot seems promising : a ghost , Ian McShane , directs a fluffy headed student , Scarlett Johansson , to investigate whether or not an English Lord , Hugh Jackman , is the notorious Tarot Card Killer of prostitutes . A magician , Woody Allen , helps the girl . Promising plot notwithstanding , the movie completely lacks charm , or humor , or atmosphere . It 's an amazingly leaden , amateurish effort for someone who has made even one previous film , never mind dozens . Perhaps Allen has had a stroke that has gone unreported in the press . Much is made of the fact that unlike in his previous films , Woody Allen , now a septuagenarian , has FINALLY allowed a younger male lead to get the girl . Not so . In fact , the plot is constructed in such a way so that the girl gets no one . There is an early scene where Johansson , for no reason central to the movie , allows herself to be gotten drunk , and seduced , by a powerful , older director . " Seduced " is a euphemism for what happens . It 's a " slam , bam , I 've gotta go " kind of moment . It bears no relation to the plot whatsoever , and it cheapens Johansson in the viewer 's eye . Why did Allen add that unnecessary scene to the movie ? Because it shows a powerful director - like Allen - having sex with the female lead . Allen gets to have his cake and eat it , too . Johansson is not yet an actress . She doesn't know how to command the screen except by wearing a tight , low cut top . She imitates Allen in a couple of scenes , and that just looks weird and sad . It doesn't help that her character is scripted as a doll who can't function without a ghost , or an elderly and less than awe-inspiring magician , telling her what to do at every turn . She is approximately half Jackman 's age , and she comes across as a very vapid screen presence in their scenes together . Audience members not obsessed with breasts deserve better in their heroines , and Jackman deserves better , too - a script that gives the heroine some intelligence and agency , and an actress who can convey those qualities . Hugh Jackman is similarly cheated by the script . Allen apparently can't stand it that Jackman is so stunningly good looking and young , and so he gives Jackman nothing to say or do . Like Johansson , he is used merely for his good looks . This is a shame , because , as Jackman has shown in any number of productions , from " Oklahoma " to " X Men , " he CAN act . Here 's the big plot twist - Jackman , suave , charming English Lord , really is a killer . So , though the movie says it is all about letting someone else , other than Allen , get the girl , she doesn't get anyone . Jackman , the man she 's been making love to , is a man who murdered a prostitute . Nice , Woody . Nice way to punish your heroine for being beyond your grasp . In a passive aggressive touch , Allen deprives his heroine of his own presence , as well , killing off his character , the magician , leaving Scarlett Johansson all alone at the end of the film . A final note : at my screening , not a single audience member laughed at any point during the film . Always a bad sign when a film is advertised as a comedy .  
  Full House is one of the worst TV series ever ! Why ? Because all the characters are so irritating that it 's impossible to bear . The best character is Joey an even he is pretty irritating occasionally . An that girl DJ , who wrote her character ? I want to kill my self every time she speaks . Not to mention when Danny start 's with his philosophy . Example : DJ won around ten thousand dollars or more in the casino . However , she 's not eighteen so she shouldn't gamble according to law . However the casino was ready to pay her the money but then Danny , her father cought 's her and don't let 's her raise that money because she is not eighteen . Oh come on , give me a break , will ya ? Since i 've seen that stupid and childish scene i instantly turned off the television . Some of the thing 's they say in this series not even a child would bought . Who in the world could think that Full House is entertaining and funny ? Every single word they say in this series seem 's like Shakespeare wrote it . Except that Shakespere knew how to write and except that he wouldn't be that childish and stupid to write something as stupid as they wrote in the script for the Full House ! For everyone who has a bad heart or any kind of bad medical condition or any will for life or any sense of the real world , i deeply recommend ' Do not watch the Full House ' ! Not even one episode as a try out . Avoid this series . Save your self from stupidity and nonsense . This is the worst television show ever ! I 'd rather watch Teletubbies then this . ' Do not watch this ' .  
  Roeg has done some great movies , but this a turkey . It has a feel of a play written by an untalented high-school student for his class assignment . The set decoration is appealing in a somewhat surrealistic way , but the actual story is insufferable hokum .  
  I just watched it . A couple of laughs , but nothing to write home about . Jason Lee looked like he was having fun . The ( long ) DVD gag reel consists almost solely of him having fits of uncontrollable laughter . Selma Blair seemed to be punching a time clock , but then again , her character was supposed to be a stick in the mud , so " well done " I guess ? Jim Brolin was surprisingly funny . ( Being married to Babs can't be a picnic . ) The soundtrack was hip , and eclectic . Larry Miller , who played Julia Stiles father ( hilariously ) , in 10 Things I Hate About You is funny here as well . He 's great , but the best aspect of this movie was the casting of Julia Stiles . I could spend two hours watching her fold laundry , and I feel like I just did .  
  Many moons ago when I was seven years old , I can vaguely remember seeing a trailer for this movie . It appealed to my naive sense of curiosity and I decided to ask my parents to take me to this movie . Being the wise adults that they are , they told me " Absolutely not ! It 's a bunch of trash . " Of course , I was very disappointed that I would not be the first kid on my block to see the " Incredible Melting Man . " Little time passed - maybe a couple of days . I forgot about " The Incredible Melting Man " and my disappointment faded . Twenty-five years passed until it re-entered the forefront of my thoughts . While surfing through channels on digital cable , I found this long-lost relic of a movie . My curiosity was piqued and I decided to finally partake in this fruit forbidden by my parents . I should have listened to them . The " Incredible Melting Man " is perhaps the worst movie known to man . It makes movies such as " Def-Con 4 , " Metalstorm " , and " Freddie Got Fingered " look like Oscar nominees . I feel violated for wasting almost two hours of my life watching this vile filth . The story was incoherent and the effects were crude even for 1977 . How anyone convinced a film company to produce this movie beyond me . Don't make the same mistake that I did . Listen to your parents if they forbade you to watch this movie . They were right .  
  With the exception of about 10 sublime minutes with HB Warner on the celestial train , this was 94 minutes of jaw-dropping horribleness ! The acting was atrocious , but the story is what I really found appalling . The acting was wooden and stilted , even by early talkies standards ( the exceptions being Lee Tracy and HB Warner , neither of whom can do wrong ) . Rose Hobart was absolutely horrid and lifeless as Julie ( as she likewise was in 1932 's Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde , an otherwise excellent flick ) . And the rest of the cast was worse , there being no words to describe their awfulness . Worse than the acting , however , was the story . For some unknown reason , Julie loves Liliom , a cad and user of women with no redeeming qualities whatsoever . He marries Julie but doesn't support her , instead lying in bed all day or hanging out with his low-life criminal pal ( Lee Tracy ) . And , oh yeah , he never has a kind word to say to Julie and he regularly beats her . Julie loves him nonetheless and continually makes excuses for him , which only seems to make him more abusive . What 's even sicker is that this movie presents this story to us as a love story . Somehow we are supposed to see Julie as a noble character whose pure love redeems Liliom . WTF ? The last 1/3 of this movie takes place after Liliom has killed himself ( a robbery plot goes awry and Liliom plunges a knife into himself rather than being taken in by the police ) . As he lay dying , he tells Julie " I beat you all the time , but I 'm not sorry for it . " When he at last dies , she finally tells him she loves him . ( Neither character ever said " I love you " to the other while they were alive . ) After his death , God 's Chief Magistrate gives Liliom one more day on earth so that he can " do something good " for his unborn daughter . The price for this is 10 years in hell . After 10 years , Liliom is allowed one day on earth to see his now 10-yr-old daughter . He approaches her in the front yard of her home and tries to cajole her into letting him " do something good " for her ; he tries to get her to play cards , he tries to give her Gabriel 's horn , but she 's not interested and rebuffs him . So he slaps her . He . Slaps . Her . And then he disappears back to the afterlife . Looking on , we see his daughter tell Julie about this . The girl says the slap didn't hurt , that it felt like a kiss . This is supposed to be the movie 's magical moment . The girl asks her mother if such a thing is possible , and Julie replies that " someone can be beat you and beat you and beat you and not hurt you at all . " Then the music swells and Liliom rides up to heaven in the celestial train . BLECH ! There was one saving grace to this film , and that is the interview between the Chief Magistrate ( HB Warner was truly magnificent here ) and Liliom on the celestial train . The Magistrate had some very profound things to say to Liliom about life and second chances and death . This scene alone made me bump this rating from 1 to 2 stars . Regarding Liliom 's suicide as a means for escaping his problems , the Magistrate says " People suppose that when they die , their difficulties are ended for them . You thought that by killing yourself that you would cancel all your responsibilities . It is not as simple as that . On Earth your name is still spoken ; your face is still remembered . As long as one is left who remembers you , so long is the matter unended . Until you have been completely forgotten , you will not be finished with the Earth , even though you are dead . " Some great sublime transcendental stuff amongst some of the most horrible trash I 've ever seen . By the way , this story has apparently been filmed many times both as " Liliom " and as the musical " Carousel . "  
  Cool idea .. botched writing , botched directing , botched editing , botched acting . Sorta makes me wish I could play God and strike everyone involved in making this film with several bolts of lightning .  
  I do agree with everything Calamine has said ! And I don't always agree with people , but what Calamine has said is very true , it is time for the girls to move on to better roles . I would like to see them succeed very much as they were a very inspirational pair growing up and I would like to see them grow as people , actresses and in their career as well as their personal life . So producers , please give the girls a chance to develop something that goes off the tangent a bit , move them into a new direction that recognises them individually and their talents in many facets . This movie that is being commented is not too bad , but as I have seen further on in their movies , their movies stay the same of typical plot and typography . When In Rome is good for audiences of younger generation but the adults who were kids when the twins were babies want to follow the twins in their successes and so hence I think we adults would like to see them make movies of different kinds , maybe some that are like the sixth sense , the hour , chocolat , that sort of movie - not saying to have just serious movies for them , humour ones too yes , but rather see them in different roles to what they have been playing in their more recent movies like this one and New York Minute . ( Note : I am from Australia so excuse my weird spelling like reognise with the s instead of z )  
  Jungle Fever is too highly stylized , stereotyped , and comes across as essentially dishonest . Wesley Snipes was wrong for the lead and there was no chemistry between him and Annabella Sciorra . Even though there 's plenty of talent in this movie , it 's mostly wasted because the parts are reduced to little more than decorative cameos . Also , instead of simply showing racism for the ugly and stupid thing it is , Spike Lee chooses to wave it around like a flag in a most whining and irritating manner . I made it through most of the film but I couldn't quite finish it , and that , for me , rarely happens .  
  This movie was exactly what I expected , not great , but also not that bad either . In my opinion PG13 movies aren't scary enough so that 's why I already knew I was going to be bored throughout the entire film . Sure there were scary things going on in the hotel room , but nothing we all haven't already seen . I guess I didn't like it because I thought there were too many twists and turns happening ; it got old and repetitive . I also didn't understand if all the things Cusack was experiencing in the room was real or not . There is no explanation for any of the events that occurred . The movie just drags on and when it finally does come to an end you want it to keep going because you are still waiting around for someone to tell you what the whole movie was about . What I did like was the special effects . Other than that there wasn't much enjoyment from it . Maybe its just me but I thought this was below average .  
  If I had not read Pat Barker 's ' Union Street ' before seeing this film , I would have liked it . Unfortuntately this is not the case . It is actually my kind of film , it is well made , and in no way do I want to say otherwise , but as an adaptation , it fails from every angle . The harrowing novel about the reality of living in a northern England working-class area grabbed hold of my heartstrings and refused to let go for weeks after I had finished . I was put through tears , repulsion , shock , anger , sympathy and misery when reading about the women of Union Street . Excellent . A novel that at times I felt I could not read any more of , but I novel I simply couldn't put down . Depressing yes , but utterly gripping . The film . Oh dear . Hollywood took Barker 's truth and reality , and showered a layer of sweet icing sugar over the top of it . A beautiful film , an inspiring soundtrack , excellent performances , a tale of hope and romance .. yes . An adaptation of ' Union Street ' .. no . The women of Union Street and their stories are condensed into Fonda 's character , their stories are touched on , but many are discarded . I accept that some of Barker 's tales are sensitive issues and are too horrific for mass viewing , and that a film with around 7 leading protagonists just isn't practical , but the content is not my main issue . The essence and the real gut of the novel is lost - darkness and rain , broken windows covered with cardboard , and the graphically described stench of poverty is replaced with sunshine , pretty houses , and a twinkling William 's score . If you enjoyed the film for its positivity and hope in the face of ' reality ' , I advise that you hesitate to read the book without first preparing yourself for something more like ' Schindler 's List ' .. but without the happy ending .  
  It pains me to write such a scathing review but by not doing so I 'm simply encouraging these people . First off , just because a film is made on a small budget does not automatically make it good nor endearing . In fact in this case , the small budget is probably the films sole achievement in that it prevented large sums of money from being squandered on a one legged race horse with the shits . Have you ever seen a comedy at the theatre ? Ever heard people laugh and thought " what the dickens are you on " ? Well even these twats weren't laughing . Things got so bad by mid way my cat took his first ever bath . This is not film , this is children .. no monkeys making images that leave you feeling like moving to France . Got to go , there 's a clown at my door ..  
  I didn't like this Bill Murray vehicle when it was originally released in the 80s , so I tried watching it again to see if my distaste for this film was down to my movie-going tastes in the 80s or was it that " Stripes " is simply a bad movie . Well , the verdict is in and " Stripes " is a bad movie . Now , " Stripes " may have been innovative comedy in the early 80s , and it may appeal to people who have gone through basic training or who are Bill Murray fans , but its still a bad movie . Why is it bad ? Mostly because " Stripes " is supposed to be a comedy but it 's just not that funny . There are some laughs , but they are few and far between . Most of the movie is consumed by the dramatic plot which is incredibly convoluted and not very interesting . This lack of comedy is especially noticeable if you 're used to more contemporary comedies such as " Anchorman " which strive for laughs in every part of the movie . " Stripes " further suffers from Bill Murray and Harold Ramis 's lack of acting ability . Bill Murray is a great comedian but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at this point in his career , and Harold Ramis is playing Harold Ramis . These two are just not good enough as actors to carry the dramatic arch of the movie . Lastly , most of the comedy that there is in " Stripes " revolves around Bill Murray 's self-centered , smart-alec man-child character so if you don't find that character funny ( like I didn't ) you 're not going to find most of what little comedy there is in " Stripes " funny either . " Stripes " is very much a movie of its era , it hasn't aged well and is not worth watching . If you want to watch an early 80 's " buddy " comedy I would recommend " Stir Crazy . " Like " Stripes " the humor in " Stir Crazy " is not as fast-paced as in contemporary comedies , but unlike " Stripes " it has aged much better and as a result is still watchable .  
  Okay , the story makes no sense , the characters lack any dimensionally , the best dialogue is ad-libs about the low quality of movie , the cinematography is dismal , and only editing saves a bit of the muddle , but Sam " Peckinpah directed the film . Somehow , his direction is not enough . For those who appreciate Peckinpah and his great work , this movie is a disappointment . Even a great cast cannot redeem the time the viewer wastes with this minimal effort . The proper response to the movie is the contempt that the director San Peckinpah , James Caan , Robert Duvall , Burt Young , Bo Hopkins , Arthur Hill , and even Gig Young bring to their work . Watch the great Peckinpah films . Skip this mess .  
  Karl Jr and his dad are now running an army on a remote island . They capture a trio of guys who stumble upon the island . Whom after a while fight back . ( well the survivors ) This one has non-stop blood , gore and carnage , which would have been good if any of it looked remotely real , or if the production didn't look like it was made with a weeks worth of saved up lunch money ( I may be overexxagerating there . it was probably just a couple days worth ) . The horrendous dubbing didn't bother me as much and I suspect if I had been really drunk , some of it MIGHT have been slightly humorous .. maybe . But as it is , at merely 78 minutes the movie still felt way too long by .. Oh I don't know .. 78 minutes . Don't waste your time . My Grade : F DVD Extras : Bonus movie : " Zombie ' 90 : Extreme Pestilence " ; and Trailers for other Shock-o-Rama released films  
  i don't know why , but after all the hype on NPR i thought this was a new movie .. all the best footage has been used for BBC docs and NatGeo projects that you have seen if you are interested in nature programs .. it has been repackaged with sappy narration and over-dramatic music for Disney to take advantage of Earth Day-there are great moments , and it is always nice to listen to Darth Vader .. oops , .. James Earl Jones speak , but I had hoped for a ground breaking movie , considering the new camera technology used in the making of this film .. it has been sanitized for a child audience , so one can actually see better footage for free on youtube .. i feel that we are due for something as ground breaking as Koyannisquatsi ( sic ) and this movie is certainly not it  
  Yesterday was Earth Day ( April 22 , 2009 ) in the US and other countries , and I went to see the full-feature movie-version of " Earth " by DisneyNature . I guess , like the auto manufacturers , Disney is trying to convince us that they care about the planet . Maybe they really do care about the planet , I don't know , but I don't think it warrants a special unit with the word " nature " in it . I do know that my youngest daughter loves Mickey Mouse , and who am I to tell a one-year old my personal feelings about Disney ? Aside from incredible cinematography , it was a typical Disney disappointment for me . Preceded by a half-dozen Disney movie trailers , rife with Disney cliché ( " circle of life " , " falling with style " ) , over-dramatic music , recycled footage ( Disney claims " 40 % new footage " ) . I was even starting to think that James Earl Jones narration is getting a bit boring . I like James Earl Jones , but his work for Disney and Morgan Freeman doing every Warner Brothers narrative starts to wear thin . I really think that Disney bought some BBC nature photography that was so spectacularly done , they felt it would sell itself if they slapped some orchestral music and recognizable sound-bites on it . And what is Disney 's obsession with showing predators chasing and killing baby animals ? There were a half-dozen such scenes , complete with bleating youngsters on the verge of getting their throats ripped out . I think Disney needs to recognize that animals have a rich and interesting life outside of life and death struggles that appeal to the action-movie oriented teenagers that got dragged to this film by their parents . I was also cognizant of how Disney stopped well short of implying that man had anything to do with the climate change . Are they so afraid of the tiny minority of deniers that they think it 's still a controversial subject ? I recommend skipping this one and renting the Blue Planet DVDs on Netflix . Nature films seem to be best done by the British at the moment .  
  Veteran director and producer Allan Dwan , whose huge string of films includes both the utterly forgettable and the recurrently shown ( for example , John Wayne in " Sands of Iwo Jima " ) tried his hand at a big musical with " I Dream of Jeanie . " Harnessing a lead cast of singers with little past film experience and , as it turned out , virtually no future , he spun a fictional and in no small part offensive story about the great American songwriter , Stephen Foster . Bill Shirley is the young , lovestruck Foster whose kindness to slaves includes giving the money saved for an engagement ring to pay the hospital cost for an injured little black boy . His intended is Inez McDowell ( Muriel Lawrence ) whose pesky younger sister , Jeanie ( Eileen Christy ) , is slowly realizing she 's in love with the nearly impecunious song-smith . Foster is in love with Inez who is revolted by the composer 's Number 1 on the Levee Hit Parade Tune , " O Susannah . " Enter minstrel Edwin P.Christy ( Ray Middleton ) to help launch the profit-making phase of Foster 's career . This is , by the musical-film standards of the early Fifties , a big production . The sets are lavish in that special Hollywood way that portrayed fakes with all the trimmings . The singers aren't half bad and the Foster songs are almost impossible to ruin . But this is also a literal whitewash of the antebellum South . The biggest number features black-face for all on stage , an historical anomaly and a contemporary piece of unthinking racism . Were these portrayals of blacks anywhere near reality , the abolitionists would be rightly condemned for interfering with so beneficent an institution . " I Dream of Jeanie " apparently sank into the studio 's vault with barely a death whisper . Now revived by Alpha Video for a mere $ 4.99 it 's a period piece with charming songs and repulsive sentimentalizing about the victims of America 's great crime , slavery . This was what Hollywood was putting out two years before Brown v . Board of Education . Must have warmed the hearts of some moviegoers who wore their bed linen to the theater .  
  Incredibly muddled , off-putting and ultimately ludicrous ( " the horses , oh my God , the horses ! " ) thriller . It 's creepy at times , but it has one of the worst scripts ever written for a horror film . Watch how in the final 10 minutes everybody " magically " does exactly what the plot needs for the " resolution " to occur . Bland performances by the leads , a typically eccentric one by Richard Lynch . The video transfer is a real hack job , cutting scenes in half and making the movie even more difficult to understand . 0 out of 4 stars .  
  This movie is about a very sexy Olympic track star who is hired to coach a high school boys ' basketball team . Similar to Goldie Hawn 's WILDCATS , it stars Cathy Lee Crosby in the title role , and she does as about as well as the script allows . I think Racquel Welch would have been a better choice , but considering the film 's apparent TV movie budget , they probably couldn't afford her . Cathy Lee does look great in every shot , but we never get to see her completely nude . The story is pretty predictable , to say the least , offering no surprises . A young and lucky Michael Biehn has the male lead role . He is the star on the team and also the love interest for Cathy Lee . Keenan Wynn has a few amusing scenes as the rich old man who runs the athletic program and doesn't think a woman should coach sports . This point is brought up throughout the film , and , needless to say , is dated . Ironically , Cathy Lee doesn't put her team through any unorthodox practice sessions ; she doesn't do anything a male coach wouldn't do . There is a funny subplot involving a tall and not-so-bright player who undergoes hypnosis in order to pass his classes and play like pro basketball player Sydney Wicks . It looks like everyone had a good time making this film , but the only real reason to see it is for Cathy Lee Crosby . She 's not that great an actress , but she has a dazzling smile , beautiful hair , and a very tan body .  
  This one acts as a satire during the women 's rights movement era . Of course , that doesn't mean COACH ( the movie ) is a wonderful experience to behold . It runs into the same vein as FASTBREAK ( which was better , but still tame ) , and is basically standard fare fluff . What I mean for this movie being uninteresting is simple to recognize . Anybody who serves time away from a normal job by training a bunch of lunatics earning their way to sudden victory makes waste . It 's the same feeling you may get after watching this . A nice attempt at casting the opposite sex for a man 's duty , but I expected better things .  
  Sorry , but I will spoil both the plot line and the ending for you in hopes of avoiding a holiday fiasco like the one that I now face . The father dies and the mother asks Santa in a letter to bring him back to the family for Christmas , .. and Santa does . Dad is peachy , happy healthy and totally unaware of the fact that he had died . All ends syrupy sweet . But as a parent who recently watched my five year-old lose his best canine friend , it was a horror flick . Now my son is convinced that all he has to do to bring his buddy back is to ask Santa ! Do not underestimate the willpower of a young heart - no amount of persuasion will convince him that it was only a movie and that his dog is NOT coming back for Christmas . It has been heart breaking to watch his joy only to know that Christmas Eve he will have to face his loss afresh . Shame on you on behalf of all the believers that have lost a loved one recently . It is hard enough to deal with the loss one time for a child , but there are some wishes that we shouldn't even portray as a possibility .  
  This was the WORST Christmas movie I ever saw . I took my two small children to see this . It was the darkest , most dismal plot - family has no money , mom loses her job , father gets killed in the bank , bank robber steals family car with both kids in the back and after high speed chase , drives off the bridge and drowns them in the river . Mom is left all alone . No wonder her Christmas spririt is gone . Christmas angels do not rescue children that have drowned , and Santa does not bring back dead fathers ! I thought this was the WORST message to send children . Better to tell them that there is NO Santa than show them a movie like this !  
  this show is awful . no comedy , no plot no good characters . America are you blind give the award to real shows . i hate this show along with 30 rock . honestly I 'm so glad they canceled this show . thank you CBS . keep two and a half men , keep Christine , keep rules of engagement keep how i meet your mother which really isn't funny but a lot funnier than this . this show is a rip off of friends . with the same director so thats okay . but keep this show gone and never bring it back . never ever ever ever . the only reason i didn't give it a 1 rating is because it keep my awake instead of asleep . those are the types of movies or TV shows that i give a one . the only reason i was still awake was because of the audiences laughter and i was looking forward to the next show . i really wish this show was funny sorry but my opinion stupid . very stupid . i don't see why everyone loves it . my opinion again . but i also find big bang theory kinda stupid . my bad smart . the class bye bye now i have a smile and it is not from watching your show .  
  It is difficult to find any positives in this movie . Seems as though the producer needed to make a buck without much effort & hence we are treated to a full showing of Galaxy which is the lamest excuse for a movie in history . The police girls looked extremely sexy in their little uniforms . More action shots of the two cops & a lot less of Galaxy would have been the way to go . Of course that would add to the budget so they decided to fill the space with that wretched rerun . Ms Albright does excellent looking sexy & her acting is first rate . Ms Stabs whom I had heard of but not seen on screen before also looked very desirable but seems to lack basic acting talent . Apart from Ms Albright this is real garbage .  
  This is an " anthology " horror film . It 's made up of 4 short stories taken from the fiction of Robert Bloch ( who wrote for Weird Tales and was personal friends with H.P. Lovecraft , but is most famous for the original story " Psycho " ) . The quality of the stories is very uneven and I didn't think very much about the film was creepy or horrific at all . It would have been better to do it as a comedy like " Comedy of Terrors . " Only the last of the 4 stories was really done in a humorous way , and it 's probably the best of them ( the one with Ingrid Pitt ) . I 've seen a few of these Amicus anthology films and the only one that was really worth my time was Freddie Francis ' " Tales from the Crypt . " The anthology style works well for the producers , because it means that they can hire a bunch of " big name " actors , employ them for only one week of shooting or so , and then bring in the next big name . So you essentially pay for 6 weeks of movie star salary but get 5 or 6 different names on the marquee . But that 's very unfortunate for the audience , because the audience would like to see some scenes with Peter Cushing , Christopher Lee , and Ingrid Pitt actually acting together . Instead they 're stuck in these vignettes by themselves . So let 's take them one at a time , briefly . The first story has Denholm Elliot , who does a really admirable job of trying to bring some dignity to his silly role as a writer terrorized by his own character . Unfortunately the actor who plays Dominic , the source of the horror , Tom Adams , just looks silly which ruins any possible horror . There 's some hilarious stuff if you want to laugh at it though , like the scene where Dominic kills Elliot 's psychiatrist . It 's the patented scene where the killer creeps up behind the victim but nobody is watching , so the whole audience is supposed to shout out " LOOK OUT BEHIND YOU ! " The second story is the one with Peter Cushing . God I love that man so much . Too bad so many of his films , like this one , pretty much stink . In the story he 's supposed to be pining away for a long-lost love , and he sees her likeness in a wax museum . It 's a completely predictable story that goes nowhere . Then you have the bit with Christopher Lee , where he plays the father of a little kid who turns out to be a witch . Again this bit could have been fun if it had been played for laughs . But instead we 're supposed to be horrified when Lee slaps the child and surprised when she turns out to be evil . The actress , Chloe Franks , was pretty good in that type of " Bad Seed " role though . The last story is kind of amusing .. Ingrid Pitt plays an actress and Jon Pertwee plays an actor who accidentally buys a vampire cape that turns him into a real vampire . That 's about all the story has to offer . I was surprised at how bad Ingrid Pitt 's English is , I guess she must have been dubbed in some of the other films I 've seen her in . Not a very memorable film or one that I would recommend to anyone but horror completists .  
  I have always said that some plays by their very nature just can't be translated to film , and this one is a prime example . As a play , this is a very funny farcical satire of the Catholic church , with a razor wit and a central character who is so shockingly unreal we have to root for her even when she starts murdering her parishioners ( one of whom made the fatal mistake of admitting he had not sinned since his last confession , so she feels she is sending him straight to heaven ) . That 's just one example of how far outside of reality the play goes , and in the make believe world of the theater , it works . However , that kind of heightened reality rarely works on film , and it certainly doesn't here . Director Marshall Brickman has assembled a fine cast who do great work , but by presenting all this absurdity in a realistic fashion the comedy becomes tragedy and you are left with an empty feeling in the pit of your stomach . Seek out a production of the stage play instead , you won't be disappointed .  
  We don't have this on television in England but I walked it over the Internet on YouTube . It 's dumb , immature and boring ! This is from the creator of " Earthworm Jim " Douglas TenNapel , I never got into that cartoon but I must admit it better than this . The cartoonist hasn't done anything for years since now . For Doug TenNapel , this is a comeback travesty and an all time low ! The story is about three cats who inherit a house and lots of money off their dead old lady master . They are argumentative and keep on disagreeing on what their want to spend their money on . " BORING " ! The animation is dreadful . The main characters are meant to be cats , right ? But they don't look nothing like cats ! Just weird animal monster-looking creatures with big mouths , pointed teeth and bulgy eyes ! The human and other animal characters are also drawn real ugly ! The theme song is terrible and irritating ! Also the stories are lame and are most probably copied from older shows . It surprised me how this show got 7.5/10 votes of other IMDb viewers . Television really isn't what is used to be ! But now most of them is dumb , cheaply made and boring . Some of you on the website might not agree with me well I 'm sorry but this is a total waste of money and a complete and utter waste of your time and feel glad that Britain don't have too tolerate this crap ( oh yeah , if you have digital you have to ) but I don't , so it not my problem ! Loser ! 2/10 ( and it 's very lucky to get that because I 've given other shows worst ! ) .  
  Most of the French films I 've seen - and enjoyed - were more talk than action , but that 's okay . I found them interesting , well-photographed and with intriguing actors . ( However , I did at one point wonder if Gerald Depardieu was in every French film ever made ! It seemed that way . ) This movie has the same interesting visuals and had a good opening . But then it became talk , talk and more talk .. which is fine for a drama but not for a murder mystery . After awhile , I almost fell asleep watching this . Actually , the film was more like a play with almost all the scenes played out in one room . Thus , if you love plays , you should like this .. but I want a little more bang for a murder story .  
  Three Stooges - Have Rocket , Will Travel - 1959 This was the first feature length film to star the Stooges and it is pretty bad . It makes THE THREE STOOGES GO AROUND THE WORLD IN A DAZE ( from 1963 ) look like a masterpiece . The Stooges are janitors at a rocket place . They climb into a rocket and it goes to Venus . They meet some stuff there including a talking unicorn they call " Uni " which they bring back to Earth with them . " Uni " speaks like an average , pleasant person - ' Oh , hello . How are you ? Lovely planet here . Hope you like it . ' Hilarious . Very few gags and so many of the scenes just go on and on and on . The Stooges arrive back from space and the film is over as far as the story goes , but no one told that to the film makers for the picture continues for another 10 minutes or so at a party where nothing much happens . The Stooges leave the party and then the film is almost over . High point of the film - the end where the Stooges sing a dapper little song about their journey . The Larry and Curly Joe hit Moe in the face with two pies . Brutal . Another writer mentioned the fine musical score . Huh ? The only music I even noticed were two classic tunes - I 'LL TAKE ROMANCE and THERE GOES THAT SONG AGAIN , both of which are played at the party . And * that * really is the high point of the picture - music from old Columbia films . The tall sexy blonde was nice . Awful - a brand new VHS video from the 99 Cents Only store .  
  Add to the list of caricatures : a Southern preacher and " congregation , " a torch singer ( Sophie Tucker ? ) , a dancing chorus , and The Mills Brothers - it only makes it worse . Contemptible burlesques of " Negro " performers , who themselves often appear in films to be parodying themselves and their race . Though the " Negro comedy " may have been accepted in its day , it 's extremely offensive today , and I doubt that it was ever funny . Though I wouldn't have been offended , I don't think that I 'd have laughed at the feeble attempts at humor . As an 11-year-old white boy , however , I might not have understood some of it .  
  With a cast of stalwart British character actors and pleasing photography of 1950s Britain , I had hoped and expected to be more entertained by this film . Unfortunately I found myself glued to it for the wrong reasons - I couldn't quite believe how awful it was . I must have watched thousands of old films and am always ready to make allowances for them being products of their time , but this was really hard going . As others have noted , a major problem is that it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be : a gentle romantic comedy , a slapstick comedy or a musical . I was a bit gobsmacked when Jeannie Carson suddenly broke into song about 15 minutes in ! It 's not believable on any level , either the storyline itself or the fact that Daisy never appears to have an ounce of menace in her at any time . Other aspects which defied credibility included the casting of suave Donald Sinden as a songwriter ( a songwriter for God 's sake ! ) , the fact he has Diana Dors for a fiancée and doesn't appear to have the slightest interest in her ( I mean , Diana Dors ! Come on ! ) and a ludicrous scene in a song publisher 's office . The whole thing 's silly in the worst possible way . If I had to pick a favourite scene it would be the one at the very beginning with that wonderful actor Wilfred Lawson - after that everything went downhill in a big way .  
  This adaptation , like 1949 's * The Heiress * , is based on the Henry James novel . * The Heiress * , starring Olivia de Havilland , remains as a well-respected piece of work , though less true to James ' original story than this new remake , which retains James ' original title . It is the story of a awkward , yet loving daughter ( Leigh ) , devoted to her father ( Finney ) after her mother dies during childbirth . The arrogant father holds his daughter in no esteem whatsoever , and considers her , as well as all women , simpleminded . When a young man ( Chaplin ) of good family and little fortune comes courting , the Father is naturally suspicious , but feeling so sure that his daughter could hold no interest for any man , is convinced that the young man is a fortune hunter and forbids her to see him . Leigh is a controversial actress  most either love her or hate her  and she always has a particular edginess and tenseness to her style , like she 's acting through gritted teeth . She 's not bad in this , and she handles her role relatively deftly  it 's just an awkward role for any actress , making the audience want to grab the character by her shoulders and shake her until she comes to her senses . While the character garners a lot of sympathy , she 's not particularly likable . The very handsome and immensely appealing Ben Chaplin ( previously seen in * The Truth About Cats and Dogs * ) plays his role with the exact amount of mystery required to keep the audience guessing whether he is after her fortune , or is really in love with her . Maggie Smith is one of the finest actresses alive and raises the level of the movie considerably with her portrayal of the well-meaning aunt . Finney is marvelous , of course , as the father who threatens to disinherit his daughter for her disobedience , but the daughter is willing to risk that for the man she loves . But does her ardent suitor still want her without her fortune ? This is only one instance where * Washington Square * differs from * The Heiress * . Another instance is the ability to stick with it . It is a handsome movie that is as tedious as a dripping faucet , offering too little story in too long of a movie .  
  Edwin Porter 's 1903 short film entitled " The Great Train Robbery " bursts onto the screen with so much excitement and ingenuity that one prepares to be blown away by another pioneering early film . Just like Melies ' " A Trip to the Moon " , critics have hailed this as being the film that introduced the western genre into modern cinema . In my eyes , they were right . It had everything from the planning , the actual heist of the train , the murder of an unwanted civilian , and that looming final scene that makes you realize that these villains mean business  it was all monumental for its time . From here to Eastwood , every western filmmaker has used Porter 's image in some form or another to create their own story . One cannot say that this film didn't open the door , but the struggle comes from the story itself . The genre was defined by Porter , but outside of its initial excitement  there really isn't anything to grapple onto . Perhaps I am jaded by the cliché modern westerns and their haphazard messages , but how can something be cliché before being cliché ? To me , " The Great Train Robbery " seemed forced , untraceable , and unsurprising . Unlike Melies , Porter tells a very linear story . Robbers change the course of a train , rob it , then shoot at random people just to prove they are the true villains , and the final scene ends like any predestined film , without any surprises or glitches , and that looming man with a gun to your proverbial face . It is bland . Porter 's film is boring . In the edition I watched , there was an addition of color near to the end to emphasize emotion , which felt cheap and was not encouraging to the filmmaker , or to the viewer . The issue remains that while it is important , Porter 's film has been borrowed time and time again , it has in effect become diluted . The story itself does not carry the emotional powerhouse it once has . Unlike Melies early film , I cannot watch this again . I know what has happened , I know there is very little missing from behind the scenes , and that finally it is just what it has set out to be  a simple story leading from point A to point B to point C . This issue is not only my gripe with this film , but also the strongest element to see in such an early film . While it was dull , the fact that it told such a strong narrative  that our characters were characters with motives and drives , was outstanding to see . In an era where nonfiction films seemed mainstream , this broke the mold . Again , not that I am jumping on the prophetic bandwagon about this film  it is an important film  it just isn't a great film . Overall , I was eager to jump into this film to see where the roots of the western genre were planted , but I was equally as happy to leave this film behind . Porter is a talented director , and G.M. Anderson obviously went on to be very successful in the created field , but I just wasn't in awe of the film . I wasn't expecting big budget effects like Melies work , nor was I expecting a duplicate of " A Trip to the Moon " , but I did want to see the same creativity , exploration , and originality . I felt Porter played it safe , if that can be said with such an early film , but I couldn't feel the excitement as our villains did their evil deeds . I wasn't rooting for anyone , and the final conclusion proved that the kitschy-ness of it had worn off minutes after the film started . It was pioneering , but not monumental . " The Great Train Robbery " has lost its space in the time capsule of cinema . Grade : * out of *  
  Truly awful film made by cinematographer-turned-director Ted Tetzlaff . Decent enough looking film but for a time-bomb movie totally devoid of any tension whatsoever . Ford , as someone put it here , sleepwalks though this one with his characteristic smirk . There are some details thrown around - Canadian ex-army or RAF , defused bombs in the war , his wife is leaving him - but none of these back stories add up to much . The bomber himself is a complete mystery . Why is he trying to blow up this shipment of mines ? For that matter , what time period are we talking about here ? WWII or postwar ? I assumed the latter which makes bomber 's motive even more salient . Generally , though , just a horrible film . There are plenty of good time-bomb flicks to skip this one . Watch any episode of " Danger UXB " for a more exciting time , at about the same running time .  
  This show is dull , lame , and basically rips off all sorts of various things in order to make it " original . " First off : The animation is so ugly .. Johnny 's hideous .. and everyone 's annoying . The twins look like teen female Dexters from " Dexter 's Lab , " and Johnny is almost like a more intelligent male Dee Dee ( also from " Dexter 's Lab . " ) Secondly : The plots .. are painfully lame , making them hard to follow . The gags are corny , and nothing really makes me feel compelled to laugh a little bit .. especially when it tries to be funny . I only saw two episodes , but those alone turned me off . Third off : The whole theme song starts off by ripping off the tune to Green Day 's " American Idiot . " And , while I am not a big fan of that band , I find it really dumb that they would take the same opening melody , and then subtly change it , in order to make it their own . Case in point .. it 's a big fat ugly bore . 1/10  
  A stale " misfits in the army " saga , which half-heartedly attempts to be both surreal ( the foreign subtitles ) AND vulgar ( the flatulence gags ) , but just ends up being a mix of many different kinds of humor , none of them followed very successfully . Barbara Bach , the Bond Girl from " The Spy Who Loved Me " , has only two or three brief scenes . What a waste ! ( * 1/2 )  
  While the original titillates the intellect , this cheap remake is designed purely to shock the sensibilities . Instead of intricate plot-twists , this so-called thriller just features sudden and seemingly random story changes that serve only to debase it further with each bizarre development . Worst of all , replacing the original spicy dialog is an overturned saltshaker full of unnecessary four-letter words , leaving behind a stark , but uninteresting taste . There was promise-unfulfilled promise . The prospect of Michael Caine pulling off a Patty Duke-like Keller-to-Sullivan graduation is admittedly intriguing . Unfortunately , this brilliant and respected actor only tarnished his reputation , first by accepting the role in this horribly re-scripted nonsense and then by turning in a performance that only looks competent when compared to Jude Law 's amateurish overacting . If you haven't seen the classic original , overlook its dated visuals and gimmicks . Hunt it down , watch it , and just enjoy a story and a half . As for the remake , pass on this insult to the original .  
  If you made a genre flick in the late 80s , you basically had a 50/50 chance it would either be set underwater or in a prison ( sadly , we never got an underwater prison flick ) . Framed for murder by mafia boss Moretti ( Anthony Franciosa ) , Derek Keillor ( Dennis Cole ) ends up on death row , right alongside the mob boss ' brother Frankie ( Frank Sarcinello Jr . ) . But this is the least of Derek 's problems as rogue government agent ( and mob stoolie ) Col . Burgess ( John Saxon , who also directs ) is using the prison as a testing ground for a new supervirus . This is the only flick Saxon directed during his storied career . For a guy who has worked with tons of directors , it appears the only ones he picked up any tips from were the cheap-o Italian ones . Sure , it is low budget , but that can't excuse the stilted staging , shooting gaffes , or clumsy exposition in the first 15 minutes . To his credit , Saxon did make it slightly gory and he works in a hilarious nude scene ( our lead falls asleep during a prison riot only to fantasize about a female scientist ) . Cole , who looks like a more rugged Jan-Michael Vincent , is decent as the stoic lead and Franciosa - sporting a really bad rug - gives it his all as the cliché mob boss . The end takes place at Marty McKee 's favorite location , Bronson Canyon . Retromedia released this on DVD as ZOMBIE DEATH HOUSE .  
  watch a team of bomb disposal experts in Iraq count down their time before they can go home . That in itself sounds boring . Every time that little caption came up telling us how long they had left , it just caused this film with no plot to drag on and on . hurry up and finish your time there so we can all go home . I must be missing something . I 'm a great fan of war films if they are done well . This had " jarhead " syndrome . A film that at times was beautifully shot , but cinematography doesn't stop it from being totally dull and pointless . And get over the slow mo " cartridges coming out of the gun " shot already . they could have saved money and just got stock footage from any other film with a gun in it . I didn't have any empathy for the main guy in it , i was constantly hoping that his recklessness would cause him to die . In fact the film would have worked much better if he had . I read some reviews and seemed to get the feeling that those who had been in the armed forces disliked it , and everyone else loved it . I have never been in the forces , and I 'm with them . It 's pretentious drivel . the 3 stars are for the cinematography .  
  I really liked ZB1 . Really , I did . I have no problem with extremely low-budget movies , and I have enjoyed movies with worse production values than ZB3 ( if you can imagine such a thing . check out ' wiseguys vs . zombies , ' if you 're interested ) . Indeed , I prefer lower budget zombie films , because I am suspicious that Hollywood directors do not understand what zombies are ' about . ' But ZB3 was just so bad . It was retarded . I don't want to bother being dignified in my criticism . I want my 90 minutes back , etc . Except that it really only took ~ 80 minutes , because partway through I put it into 1.4X fast forward . Okay , here 's some criticism . 1 . The pacing was TERRIBLE . Everyone talked in monologues . Even when someone just had a single line , the camera work and the editing and the insertion of a bunch of F-bombs into every sentence made the line FEEL like a monologue . At first I was excited about the 90 minute running time compared to ZB1 's 70 minutes , but there were actually fewer ' events ' in ZB3 . It 's all talking . 2 . The gore effects got stupider . Just glop rubbed around on people 's tummies . 3 . Despite the epic exposition , there really wasn't a plot . And the exposition is indeed epic ! I won't spoil it , if you 're going to watch it . ( Don't watch it . ) But then , it 's just a bunch of lame characters walking around and bickering for ~ 80 minutes . or fewer , if you so choose .  
  Nick Millard aka Nick Phillips should have left well-enough alone when he made " Criminally Insane " 10 years before the release of this god-awful waste of time and effort . The fact that the original " Criminally Insane " was less than an hour in length should have clued him into the fact that he had probably milked this storyline for all he was going to get out of it .. but instead he opts to use TONS of footage from the original in this one as well , even to the point of recycling the original opening credit sequence ! Unfortunately , bringing back the rapidly aging Priscilla Alden did not save this one . What little bit of original footage there was in this flick looks as if it were filmed with a rented hand-held camcorder ! If this film cost more than $ 100 to make I would be very surprised and I would be equally surprised if it made anything close to that amount ! Avoid this one and watch the original instead !  
  The movie is actually too slow . There are some nice images but it cannot outweigh the fact that the movie is in fact boring . You see a sexual intercourse a lot of watermelons and a sexual intercourse while eating a melon and maybe a little bit more . It may sound even interesting to someone but believe me to watch it for 2 hours isn't fun at all . Though you laugh several times but it 's really not enough and it may be more out of despair and disbelieve than out of fun . To disturb the boredom director tries to put few movie video-clips into the movie . They are really colorful clips of absurd songs maybe from the 50 's but it 's hard to say exactly and they are trying to be funny so hard that it 's really sad . Several times you have a feeling that the plot could evolve into something , that a powerful scene is being created but at the end it just somehow evaporates and that 's it . Beside the clips there are hardly any dialogs let alone music . The director is trying to be original and artistic at all cost . Personally I cannot recommend the movie . I believe that art is something that shouldn't be boring . During the projection there was yawning all around the cinema which just corroborates my short review .  
  This film comes as the ultimate disappointment in Tsai Ming-Liang for me . It oozes laziness from its every frame . So I 'm not going to analyse it thoroughly either . But some observations : 1 . If the premise is drought , why we get to see city landscapes with blooming green trees ? I wonder if that was supposed to mean something in the metaphorical context of the film ( in which thirst notifies the craving for intimacy , and watermelon the trivial substitute , sex ) . Or it is only a matter of lousy film-making , not giving a damn about being coherent . 2 . We don't get to know what had happened to the porn actress , why she is unconscious or , presumably , dead . It seems a question of no importance as long as the message of supreme alienation is successfully ( = bombastically ) delivered , but in retrospect , her inert body proves to be a cheap dramaturgical gimmick , a pretext  just as gratuitous and exploitative as the activity it is employed in . 3 . Nothing is expressed in this movie that Antonioni hadn't expressed better 40 years ago  and without needlessly humiliating his actors . 4 . The musical numbers ( recycled from ' The Hole ' ) felt like a secondary-schooler 's idea of artistic counterpointing , executed on that very secondary-school level of skill . If that was the point , the point sucked .  
  This film is really bad . It maybe harsh , but it is . It really is . Poor script , every vampire cliché in the book is used , and no sympathy is given at all to the origins of the main character .. i . e . ole Dracula . There have been some truly brilliant Dracula / vampire movies in the past , but this doesn't even make it into the " dire " slot . Take a selection of people who seem to have dropped out of a teen-slasher move , add a dribble of Dracula Lore and mix in a heady tonic of religious / surreal day-dreaming .. and you get a confusing mess of a film - Dracula 2000 . I really cannot find any good things to say about this movie , as if it wasn't bad enough that it was made in the first place , they seem to have made Johnny Lee Miller effect an English accent .. Whats the problem with that I hear you cry .. Well , he is English , but he sounds like an American trying to do an English accent . All in all you may as well say your money ( if you were thinking of buying it ) , or rent it out , watch it , and discover for yourself why it 's about as scary as the Tellytubbies . P.S. Although La La is pretty frightening !  
  It 's hard to say what was the worst thing about this show : the bad acting , poor acoustics of different portions , bad CGI , improper sets for the period , the poor script . It would have been nice if the script followed the original tale a bit closer - there 's enough tension and good material in Beowulf to provide a great deal of good material , and a better story line , than the scriptwriters could come up with . And why introduce a strange new weapon like a crossbow that fires explosive bolts ? I see that this movie was made in " only " 21 days . It shows in the lack of quality . I 'm beginning to think this is general ( poor ) attitude taken by Sci-Fi channel ( and others ) when it comes to making movies out of classic tales in the past few years . What a waste !  
  A very cheesy and dull road movie , with the intention to be hip and modern , shown in the editing style and some weird camera angles , resulting only in sleepiness . The cast is wasted , the writing is stupid and pretentious . The only thing worthwhile is the top-notch Lalo Schifrin 's soundtrack , really cool and also the opening sequence , very original and interesting . Run if you can , the bad opinions and comments about this flick are totally deserved ; it is really pure garbage . Of course that this has its charm , of watching a movie which everybody would not drop the beer glass on if it were on fire , but save it for a stormy day where you have absolutely nothing else to do .  
  What 's that there in the skies ? Is it a plane ? Is it Superman ? Err , no It 's a TURTLE ! ? ! See , that 's what becomes of the Cold War ! Nothing but bad news and other issues ! The Americans shoot down a Russian combat plane somewhere over Artic territory and the subsequent explosion defrosts & literally awakens the giant prehistoric turtle-creature named Gammera . He / she is not a very friendly critter as it promptly ensues to destroy everything and everyone on its path . The arguing governments finally decide to kill the ugly bastard with a brand new and super-sophisticated ice-bomb , but Gammera has another surprise in store The damn turtle can fly ! The first time this happens results in a tremendously grotesque and hilarious sequence ! Gammera lies on his back looking defeated when suddenly fire blows from his armpits and he skyrockets himself up in the air . How can you not love that ? Then there 's also a dire sub plot about an annoying kid who 's able to telepathically communicate with the monster , but that 's just not interesting enough . Flying turtle , people ! There 's very little else to write about this Japanese ( and American re-edited ) Sci-Fi effort , apart from that it 's an obvious and totally shameless rip-off of such classics like the original Godzilla and The Beast from 20.000 Fathoms . The effects and monster designs are extremely hokey and , unlike the aforementioned films , it never succeeds in creating an apocalyptic ambiance . Respectable actors like Brian Donlevy ( " The Quatermass Experiment " ) and Dick O'Neill ( " Wolfen " ) seem unaware of what film set they 're on and even the original Japanese mayhem-scenes aren't very convincing . Gammera 's very own and personalized theme-song is rather cool , though , so it gets one extra point for that .  
  If you want to see a movie about two utterly unsympathetic characters , this is the one . The acting is superb , both from John Cassavetes as the insane paranoid whom , as the saying goes , they REALLY ARE out to get , and from Peter Falk as his lifelong best friend to whom he turns for rescue . Big mistake , but since they 're both amoral mobsters , and misogynistic bastards to boot , it 's hard to decide whom to root for LESS . Only writer / director Elaine May could have gotten away with this one . I thought it interesting that in a lengthy interview with producer Michael Hausman included on the DVD , he disclosed that the two stars had " very different ideas " about the script , that the director was nearly impossible to work with , that the director of photography had impossible demands made of him , that the crew was constantly angry about being made to sit around waiting , and so on . This mood of one big VERY dysfunctional family comes across clearly on the screen .  
  I don't believe they made this film . Completely unnecessary . The first film was okay . But there was no need for a sequel , certainly not after a television series that was already a sequel to the first film . This film feels like a soap-opera . The writing is so bad , it 's utterly simple . The jokes don't come across , the acting is flat , it 's shot like a soap , it lacks any direction . The first film had a good emotional spine behind it . Every character had a little arc . It was very simple then but somehow it worked and I could see the merit of that film . But this time around , there is no cohesive story-line . The characters are dull stereotypes and nothing interesting happens . One good thing : the Brazilian boy who plays Axel Daeseleire 's son is pretty well cast . That was their one moment of creative success on this film . I hear they already shot a second television series as a sequel to ' Team Spirit 2 ' but please God , don't let them make a third feature installment ..  
  I guess there are some out there that remember Nicole Eggert from her little girl days on such TV shows as T.J. Hooker , Charles in Charge , and Who 's the Boss ? You perverts , you ! Maybe you remember her from Baywatch when she grew up and got breast implants . No matter , you will certainly forget her in this supposed comedy about man-eating aliens . There are so many things that do not make sense and are never explained . How did she recognize the alien ? Why was the alien hot for paprika and cinnamon ? Why didn't the alien eat her ? You get the picture . Before the alien eats her boyfriend and assumes his identity , you get to see her in the body of Alex Meneses . This Mexican / Ukranian beauty is the only reason to watch this trash . Stay for the shower scene and the boyfriend , and go on about your business .  
  I was one of quite a few extras in this big bomb . I just happened to be in the right place working safety for the race scenes at A.I.R. as it was know as back then . Thank goodness my scene in in the first few minutes of the movie and I don't have to sit through the whole thing . It was more of a big party than a movie set but hey , the pay was good . Attention to detail was not a strong point for this one , but who was going to know . The funny thing was seeing the cars in the track at the really slow speed and then in the movie speeded up to the what was close to normal speed . A lot of the scenes were changed as they were filmed I suppose to shave cost and time . But every one was having such a good time who cared !  
  I rented this movie because I hoped it would be one the whole family would enjoy . Although the movie is family friendly , my family did not enjoy it because it gives a false view of God . If you obey God and follow Him , you are not guaranteed success . Your football team won't always win . You won't magically get better grades . Infertility isn't always cured . You won't always get a raise . Sometimes , you 'll be stuck with the old car . God does not exist to meet our every whim . Rather , we were created to glorify Him . Sometimes we glorify Him most when things seem to be going bad for us . To live is Christ ; to die is gain .  
  It occurs to me that some of the films that have been banned during the course of cinema history were actually very important and very good films . I 'd like to argue that instead of banning challenging , controversial movies the censors should consider banning films that are so bad that they pose a threat to your IQ and your sanity . If they were to do so one of the first films to be quickly hidden away would undoubtedly be " Stroker Ace " . This film is awful with a capital ' A ' . It is the worst film Burt Reynolds ever starred in .. quite a feat for for a man with " Cannonball Run II " , " Cop And A Half " and " Rent-A-Cop " on his CV ! The wafer-thin story introduces us to successful stock car racer Stroker Ace ( Reynolds ) , a man who loves fast cars and fast women . He gets stuck in a demeaning contract with crooked promoter Clyde Torkle ( Ned Beatty ) . The contract requires him to do some humiliating promotional work for a new chain of fast food restaurants , such as dressing up as a giant chicken . Thrown into the mix are Lugs ( Jim Nabors ) , Ace 's dim-witted pal , and Pembrook Feeney ( Loni Anderson ) , a bimbo with a brain fractionally smaller than a pea who is wooed by Ace . Hal Needham , the director of this low-grade garbage , was formerly a stuntman and he made numerous films that relied on his expertise in staging spectacular stunts and car chases / races . Some of these films were OK , like " Hooper " and " Stunts Unlimited " , but with " Stroker Ace " he reaches a career nadir . The characters are so stupid that you actually feel pity for the actors playing them . Anderson especially is saddled with such a dumb role that it makes you grind your teeth with despair . The humour is weak and infantile throughout , and the stunts and race sequences are unremarkable . Even the out-takes during the closing credits ( which can be found in all the Reynolds-Needham collaborations ) are generally unfunny , which gives the impression that maybe the film wasn't much fun to make . " Stroker Ace " is a stinker of considerable magnitude .  
  This movie is about a female rape victim / comic book writer from New York that decides to get away from all that awful big city glamor and move to a dirty , run down small town where she finds refuge in a single-wide trailer on a dirt lot in the middle of 12th and nowhere . The townspeople are mentally ill , yet so is she for inviting crazy men into her trailer . Annoying is the fact that she has the ability to do exactly the right thing to place herself in dangerous circumstance after dangerous circumstance . DB Sweeney 's performance was high school at best . He 's one of those kinda-cute young actors with a sweet grin . Unfortunately career has not been kind and mother nature has been right in tow . To the previous commentator stating that the acting was " so real " , well I agree . Actually it wasn't acting . The two main characters really are pathetic , weak and incapable of making mature , healthy decisions . In brief , this movie sucks like no other , rent it to laugh at it . The real crime scene ? The atrocious Wood paneling in the trailer - enough to make ME commit murder . And lastly , she 's a artist / writer , so couldn't she afford a double-wide trailer and something other than a sun-yellow Chevy Chevette for love of god !  
  Ever notice how in his later movies Burt Reynolds ' laugh sounds like screeching brakes ? Must have been hanging out with Hal Needham too much . And from the looks of " Stroker Ace " , WAY too much . Can you believe this was based on a book ? Neither could I , but it was . And probably not a best-seller , I 'll wager . Burt 's another good-old-boy in the NASCAR circuit who hitches up with Beatty as a fried chicken magnate with designs on his team . Anderson provides what love interest there is and Nabors does his umpteenth Gomer Pyle impression as faithful mechanic / best friend Lugs . A lot of people here are friends of Burt 's or Hal 's . Others must have needed the work . And even real NASCAR drivers get in on the act , and look to have more talent than those with SAG cards . As far as laughs go , Bubba Smith ( pre - " Police Academy " ) gets them as Beatty 's chauffeur . And Petersen , in full Elvira mode , gets lots of appreciative leers as a lady who wants to get to know Lugs real well . REAL WELL . It 's a shame that Burt threw away as much time and effort in a film like " Stroker Ace " where it didn't matter whether he bothered to act or not . They didn't bother to write a character for him , why bother to act ? Two stars . Mostly for Petersen , and for the out-takes at the end . Now THEY 'RE funny .  
  This is the second movie I saw for Horrorfest this past weekend , The Gravedancers being the first . Gravedancers was better . I can only guess from watching this that the production must have been quite limited . I will admit the story started out interesting but really fizzled for me in the end . We weren't really given time to sympathize or understand any of the characters which only made each of their erratic characteristics even more annoying . I have to mention that there was also a bit of mis-casting with a 12-year-old boy acting as Sheriff . The only reason I sat through the whole film was to find out what the big secret was , which turned out to not be all that interesting . Some more background about the family would have helped but they didn't really seem like a family at all to begin with . To me , this film is so amateur that I couldn't even see putting it on DVD . The four rating is for the initial potential the story might have had . This was one to skip for horrorfest .  
  The Hamiltons tells the story of the four Hamilton siblings , teenager Francis ( Cory Knauf ) , twins Wendell ( Joseph McKelheer ) & Darlene ( Mackenzie Firgens ) & the eldest David ( Samuel ) who is now the surrogate parent in charge . The Hamilton 's move house a lot , Franics is unsure why & is unhappy with the way things are . The fact that his brother 's & sister kidnap , imprison & murder people in the basement doesn't help relax or calm Francis ' nerves either . Francis know 's something just isn't right & when he eventually finds out the truth things will never be the same again .. Co-written , co-produced & directed by Mitchell Altieri & Phil Flores as The Butcher Brothers ( who 's only other film director 's credit so far is the April Fool 's Day ( 2008 ) remake , enough said ) this was one of the ' Films to Die For ' at the 2006 After Dark Horrorfest ( or whatever it 's called ) & in keeping with pretty much all the other 's I 've seen I thought The Hamiltons was complete total & utter crap . I found the character 's really poor , very unlikable & the slow moving story failed to capture my imagination or sustain my interest over it 's 85 & a half minute too long 86 minute duration . The there 's the awful twist at the end which had me laughing out loud , there 's this really big sustained build up to what 's inside a cupboard thing in the Hamiltons basement & it 's eventually revealed to be a little boy with a teddy . Is that really supposed to scare us ? Is that really supposed to shock us ? Is that really something that is supposed to have us talking about it as the end credits roll ? Is a harmless looking young boy the best ' twist ' ending that the makers could come up with ? The boring plot plods along , it 's never made clear where the Hamiltons get all their money from to buy new houses since none of them seem to work ( except David in a slaughterhouse & I doubt that pays much ) or why they haven't been caught before now . The script tries to mix in every day drama with potent horror & it just does a terrible job of combining the two to the extent that neither aspect is memorable or effective . A really bad film that I am struggling to say anything good about . Despite being written & directed by the extreme sounding Butcher Brothers there 's no gore here , there 's a bit of blood splatter & a few scenes of girls chained up in a basement but nothing you couldn't do at home yourself with a bottle of tomato ketchup & a camcorder . The film is neither scary & since it 's got a very middle-class suburban setting there 's zero atmosphere or mood . There 's a lesbian & suggest incestuous kiss but The Hamiltons is low on the exploitation scale & there 's not much here for the horror crowd . Filmed in Petaluma in California this has that modern low budget look about it , it 's not badly made but rather forgettable . The acting by an unknown ( to me ) cast is nothing to write home about & I can't say I ever felt anything for anyone . The Hamiltons commits the cardinal sin of being both dull & boring from which it never recovers . Add to that an ultra thin story , no gore , a rubbish ending & character 's who you don't give a toss about & you have a film that did not impress me at all .  
  " The Return of Chandu " is notable , if one can say that , for the casting of Bela Lugosi as the hero rather than the villain . Why he even gets the girl . The story as such , involves the Black Magic Cult of Ubasti trying to capture the last Egyptian princess Nadji ( the delectable Maria Alba ) and use her as a sacrifice as a means of reviving their ancient leader who just happens to look like Nadji . Lugosi as Chandu , who possesses magical powers , tries to thwart the villains . Director Ray Taylor does his best with limited resources and extensive stock footage . Fans of King Kong ( 1933 ) will recognize the giant doors that were used to keep Kong at bay in several scenes . The acting is for the most part , awful . The actor who plays the high priest ( I believe Lucien Prival ) for example , uses that acting coach inspired pronunciation that was so common in the early talkies . The less said about the others the better . It is a mystery why Lugosi accepted parts in independent quickies at this stage of his career , because he was still a bankable star at Universal at this time . Maybe it was because in this case he got to play the hero and get the girl , who knows . As his career started to spiral downwards in the late 30s , this kind of fare would become the norm for Lugosi rather than the exception .  
  Pretty awful but watchable and entertaining . It 's the same old story ( if you 've lived through the 80s ) . Vietnam vets fight together as buddies against injustice back in the States . A-Team meets Death Wish , my favorite ! Time goes on , the soldiers go home , and years later a friend is in trouble . No , wait - in fact , the friend is dead and it is his dad that 's in trouble . Our first hero , Joey , is killed by an exceedingly horrifying ( super pointy ) meat tenderizer as he tries to defend his father 's small store from the local " protection " gang despite being wheelchair bound from the war . Desperate for help , the father talks to Sarge , the leader of Joey 's old unit from Vietnam , when Sarge shows up for the funeral . Well , the squeaky wheel gets the grease , and the old gang saddles up for the city . You can pretty much imagine most of the rest of the movie . The one thing that drove me crazy is that Sarge keeps haranguing his men about planning , and about how they 're really good at what they do when they plan ahead . But Joey wouldn't have been put in a wheelchair by a gunshot in Vietnam in the first place if the unit hadn't been messing around ! Then when things are going really well in the city as they battle the gangs , they do it again . For no reason at all , they completely bypass their plan and try to nail the gang without everyone being present . Phh ! I raise my hands in disgust . Foolishness ! There is also a suspicious moment when all present members of the unit make sure to try out the heroin they snatch from the gang to make sure it 's real . EVERY single one of them . Hmm .. What are you going to do ? Keep watching , I guess . The movie isn't too horrible to watch , but it IS a tease . There are all these climactic moments when nothing actually winds up happening . The most dramatic things that happen are those at the beginning of the movie - the explosives in Vietnam , Joey 's death battle , and the gang brutally kicking an innocent teddy bear aside ( poor Teddy ! ) . I guess my main beef with this movie is that I feel let down by it . Even the confusing subplots with " mystery helpers " and their bizarrely cross-purpose motives wasn't enough to save it at the end . But someday maybe it 'll all come right and they 'll make a sequel . Ha ha ha ha !  
  If you like movies about creepy towns , hotels , houses , states ( ala the Eagles " Hotel California " ) , etc . that possess the people that are " just passing through , " read almost any Stephen King novel instead . If you like the setting of " Disappearance " start by reading King 's " Desperation " but also check out " The Shining " , " Salem 's Lot " and " Needful Things . " The crow motif , the desert , the family driving in desperation to escape or avoid possession are tired . Why didn't they just make the film from the " Desperation " novel ? Maybe they approached King and he nixed ? Must be . Susan Dey and Harry Hamlin look happy to be reunited and they have both worn well over the years , but they 're still TV and direct-to-DVD caliber actors .  
  A singularly unfunny musical comedy that artificially tries to marry the then-cutting edge rock ' n ' roll explosion with the middle-class sensibilities of a suburban sitcom . The result is a jarringly dated mish-mash that will satisfy none of the audience that went for the music , but will at least keep their parents sated . A quick glance at the promo write-up on the back of the video release should give some idea of the content . Tom Ewell is a drunken agent , overplayed with so little comic ability you almost expect him to bellow " hi honey , I 'm home ! " The blurb sites him as " So funny in ' The 7 Year Itch ' " . It sounds almost like an excuse . What other film would sell itself on the fact that a leading player was good in something else ? It reads like " So funny in ' The 7 Year Itch ' .. but he 's rubbish in this " . Mansfield , a beautiful girl with rumoured 50-inch assets , is , unfortunately , a bargain basement Monroe with all the acting ability and comic timing of a rotting haddock . Her wooden delivery combined with Ewell 's OTT double-takes make this a comedy partnership from Hell . For her part , the sell gives us : " [ Jayne Mansfield ] whose more obvious talents are the cause of many of the film 's biggest laughs ! " As you can see , a movie sold on the idea that it 's lead has a big chest is not the most sophisticated of things . Most of this " humour " is men literally falling over themselves , their glasses cracking upon site of Mansfield , etc . Only the Freudian nightmare of a milk bottle overflowing casts doubt upon its " U " certificate . For the musical side , the most adenine of players are chosen . Would you really care to see Eddie Fontaine offer : " I love your eyes , I love your lips , they taste even better than potato chips " in a song called " Cool It , Baby " ? Only the incendiary Little Richard breaks out of the MOR , though is forced to sing some of his more dad-friendly songs in a four-minute sequence . And how come all the acts sing without a single microphone ? Attempted satires on the industry are broad and childlike in their conception . Technically , the picture was quite advanced , with special effects ( including a ghost-like Julie London ) and deluxe color ( Which now looks flat and artificial . In fact , with its reds that bleed and fake-looking flesh tones , it resembles a colorised movie ) . Direction , though , isn't outstanding , and the sound quality is also quite poor . Perhaps it comes down to it being so old . A time when men still smoked on screen , sickeningly cute child actors made adult remarks and black servants only got to cook and dance . ( All of which happen here ) . Yet Some Like It Hot , The African Queen , Ben Hur and many , many more stand as examples of films from the period that can still be enjoyed today , so the " good at the time " argument doesn't really stand up . At its heart The Girl Can't Help It is a cynical and patronising venture that doesn't bear close inspection . 4/10 .  
  I knew that ' Evening ' was a girlie film , so I was expecting to be bored . A wicked tease on IMDb had said that it was a ' chick flick ' but that your companion would survive . Survive ? Yes . I am still here , but when the two of us came out we were amazed to find that it had only lasted two hours - it seemed a much longer evening than that ! I suppose that , for Yanks , it is supposed to be elevating or fascinating because it is about rich people living on the beach - well , next to the beach , in a house with a wide verandah and a lawn but no apparent lawnmower . If that sort of thing impresses you it might seem quite a short film . There 's a Monty Python film about a Knight who just won't die . He ends up a wriggling ( why do Yanks add an third syllable to this word I wonder ) torso in the road still shouting threats at his nemesis . This film is also about a sort of living dead . Vanessa Redgrave ( inappropriate name for the grave dodger shown here ) goes on and on dying whilst having inappropriate guilt . She 's not worried about having been a wide-eyed , breathless bimbo , but imagines herself a murderess . Obviously , being a girlie film , there 's a chap who is supposed to be the Mr Darcy / Heathcliff character . I 'm not a woofter , so I can't claim to be a good judge of such things , but the tedious wimp who is wheeled out for this role seems only to have the title of servant in his favour . He 's a bloodless cypher . As you might gather , the main characters aren't much cop , but the minor ones manage , amazingly to be much worse . There 's a fellow whose only job is to react to the news that his girlfriend is preggers . Fair enough , but it isn't the role of Hamlet - why ham it up so badly ? Forgetting that it was a girlie film , I thought he was going to be thrown out because any decent girl-friend would have told him that face-fungus didn't flatter him , but then I realised that she must have encouraged him to grow a ' beard ' because he looked worse without it . I kept awake by noticing which actors and actresses had their earlobes attached or free and noting interesting bits of scenery - if you 're dragged along to it , see if you can spot the stuffed buffalo head , just the sort of thing you 'd expect in a beach cottage . Apart from the obligatory wedding , there is only one piece of action . You 'd have thought that they 'd have got it right . Sadly , though , the hit and run accident is carried out by a car that couldn't be there . When the accident is discovered the cast wander about shouting for a character that they can't know is nearby ( but we do as the audience ) . If they don't have any clue that the person is within a couple of miles of the place , then why do they wander about aimlessly shouting for him ? I suppose that the director 's excuse is that it is supposed to be a half-remembered dream sequence .. Another scenery item that caught my attention was a copper bottomed saucepan . I didn't think that the technology to do this was developed until the fifties .  
  I have seen every episode of this spin off . I thought the first season was a decent effort considering the expectations of following such a success that is Grey 's Anatomy . Thus i have continued to watch . I 'm afraid the second season lacks the charm , the chemistry and more importantly the drama of it 's predecessor Grey 's Anatomy . The relationships seem contrived and the acting is so-so . The writing lacks the intelligence and comedic hints seen in GA . There are shows that a formulaic but do not feel formulaic and contrived , unfortunately PP is not so . I loved Kate Walsh 's presence in GA . I 'm afraid Kate Walsh 's life in LA is simply not interesting .  
  The Choke starts as a rock band known as The Choke prepare for a gig at a nightclub called ' Club 905 ' owned & run by Guy Johnson ( Andrew Parker ) . Lead singer Dylan ( Sean Cook ) & guitar player Mike ( Jason McKee ) plan to tell the other band members , bass player London ( Brooke Bailey ) & drummer Nancy ( Tom Olson ) , that they are both going solo & their services won't be needed any longer . Once at the club Dylan prepares but Mike doesn't show up & the gig turns into a disaster . Then just as the band think things couldn't get any worse they find a dead body in the cellar , that all the doors have been locked so they can't get out & that they can't trust anyone as a mysterious killer begins picking them off one-by-one .. Produced & directed by Juan A . Mas The Choke is a standard by-the-numbers teen slasher that really doesn't have anything going for it . The script by Jessica Dolan & Susannah Lowber ( not too many horror films out there penned by ladies .. ) has some surprisingly good character 's in it & some nifty dialogue but while it 's much better than a lot of modern shot on a camcorder type horror in that respect it 's so slow & boring that even a few interesting character 's can't come anywhere close to saving it . As one would expect all the usual teen slasher clichés are used , from the isolated location the victims can't escape from , the cast of good looking teenagers who keep splitting up , a few murders & a really poor twist ending that tries to mimic something like Scream ( 1996 ) & be surprising but doesn't make a whole lot of sense when you think about it logically ( they couldn't have done some of the things they were supposed to ) & to make matters even worse I guessed who the killer was fairly early on & even though I don't want to boast I was spot on . Then there 's the fact that the makers of The Choke felt that it 's audience would be entertained by showing endless ( well it feels endless while watching it ) scenes of teenagers walking around dark corridors doing nothing in particular , I am sorry but there is only so many scenes like this that I can take before it starts to become tedious . The kill count is low , at first they all decide to stick together ( good idea ) but then they all just randomly decide to split up & go their separate ways ( bad idea when there 's a killer on the loose ) , the pace is lethargic , the kill scenes are unimaginative & to top it all off the twist ending is poor . Director Mas does alright , the film looks OK for the most part although there are the odd occasions where he uses some annoying post production editing technique like slow motion or frame skipping . The gore levels aren't really up to scratch , there 's some blood splatter , a guy with a hole in his chest , a few dead bodies & someone impaled on some metal poles . Most of the kills happen off screen with the axe kill at the end a good example of the film not actually showing anything . Since the film is about a rock band there 's quite a rock orientated soundtrack with some truly horrible , horrible rock songs used on it . I am sorry rock fans but to my ears this crap is just noise pollution . It 's not scary , there 's no real atmosphere & the lack of blood & gore is just inexcusable when the rest of the film is so bad . With a supposed budget of about $ 1,000,000 The Choke is well made with reasonable production values , it looks cheap to be sure but not as cheap as many low budget horror films look . Shot in a place called Spokane in Washington apparently . The acting is one of the films strongest points as it 's generally pretty good all round , I mean no-one is going to win an Oscar but it ain't half bad . The Choke is a throughly routine Scream style teen slasher that has one of the weakest twist endings ever & a criminal lack of blood , gore , violence , nudity & dead bodies . I mean if a slasher hasn't got any sex or gore then what 's the point ? Those are the only things that the average slasher is worth watching for , right ?  
  I really hate most end of the world movies . They show what jaded Hollywood people think of the rest of the world , and they clearly think we 're a bunch of sadistic idiots ( or at least that watching sadistic idiots react to things is somehow entertaining ) . I 've been to L.A. many times , I have family that works in show business , and I just want to say that these are the * last * people we should be looking to for a reality check . Some disaster movies at least paint a clever picture : Children of Men , 12 Monkeys , but usually the message is just " people will do anything to survive , all is dark and sad and purposeless , we should all be ashamed of ourselves " . Don't get me wrong , I like the idea of a story that explores throwing off the system of social order and testing people 's mettle in the face of horror , and I do believe some people would act like this film portrayed , but sadistic idiots aside , I seriously doubt society would just dissolve into every man for himself , that 's just insulting .  
  I 've read comments that you shouldn't watch this film if you 're looking for stirring Shakespearian dialogue . This is true , unfortunately , because all the stirring dialogue , this wonderful play contains , has been cut , and replaced with songs . I 've read this play , and recently was lucky enough to see it performed , at it remains one of my favourite Shakespearian Comedies , but this movie seems to take all that I like about it away . The Princess , though no doubt doing what she was directed to do , had no regal bearing , and all the girls seemed to lose the cleverness of their characters - also affected by unwise cuts , which not only took away the female characters already sparse dialogue , but took comments out of context - it was a little unnerving to hear the Princess proclaim ; " We are wise girls to mock our lovers so ! " , when mocking had not taken place at all . The news reels throughout the film also disrupted the flow , and took away many excellent scenes , as they showed the information in the scenes after them , and were in modern phrasing . In conclusion , an excellent play , ruined by an odd concept , and unwise cuts . Kenneth , I usually love what you do . What were you thinking ?  
  This film is so unbelievable ; - the whole premise is bunkum ; the fact that a serial killer ( vampire or otherwise ) could fly around untraced and kill as many people as the film implies is laughable . The vampire himself would not look out of place in a Bela Lugosi film . Most of the acting is so wooden the actors should be treated for dry rot . I await the day when someone makes a decent film from a Steven King novel ( with the exception , possibly , of Stand by Me ) . This film suffers from what most Stephen King films do - lack of money used for the " special " effects , poor actors , appalling characterisation and dialogue . This film is cheap , tacky and fails in everything it tries to do .  
  You ever get that itch to just kill an hour or two doing chores and watching a movie so bad it defies reason ? Well , out renting movies one weekend i see the box art for this one and see the T-Rex . Knowing full well that the dinosaur on the package was the T-Rex from Jurassic Park , I KNEW I had to rent this just cause I was in the mood for a bad movie . I was not disappointed in the least . Mad scientists , secret formulas , a company more concerned about its fortune and shareholders than lives , and of course , a big , poorly animated , sock-puppet T-Rex . Is it me our through out the movie was there scenes clearly spliced from other movies ? Not to mention the Rex 's hungry is never satisfied .. ever . How he has hungry is beyond me because he actually doesn't have an throat ( Really if you look down his mouth when he roars , it 's solid .. like a toy or something ) . Now , I like watching incredibly bad B-Movies from time to time because it reminds me how much better a blockbuster movie is . This one was hilarious . I 'm not even sure if this was supposed to be a thriller or a comedy , because there are scenes where , make no mistake , you will laugh . Do I blame the movie 's budget .. yes , but the acting didn't help either . OK , Tony Todd was actually pretty good , as for some of the female roles .. when you cry shouldn't " tears " come out ? Meh , I am not going to be angry at this movie , i knew what i was getting into and if you 're looking for a bad movie to watch with friends , here 's what I recommend : Watch this movie , then immediately watch Jurassic Park and then Lost World back to back . You will be writing Mr . Spielberg thank you letters the next day .  
  What " Noise " fails to do is get us to understand its character . Tim Robbins plays an obsessive New Yorker who can't deal with the obtrusive noises of the city any longer , particularly car alarms . It 's an odd idea for a film , which has about as much creative credibility as " Death Wish . " It is clever at points ; particularly a scene in which our hero is trying to read through Hagel , " I 'm too stupid to be understanding this . " He reads and rereads a paragraph in confusion , we read it and don't get it either . Just then a car alarm goes off . Throughout the movie is constant interference of alarms and city noises . Though , all in all it does little to help us understand our hero , who allows this all to ruin his marriage and gets distracted with side plots instead of digging deeper-into his persona . The film-making itself is too oblivious to notice its own sound problems , shoddy editing , and visible boom mikes . No , " Noise " isn't all-bad . William Hurt is at least colorful . At least the ending doesn't fall flat . Overall it drives home a logistical point , one you haven't probably thought of . At least I hadn't . Though all in all , ninety minutes long , it couldn't have ended sooner . The story dragged on and seemed to be lost as soon as it started . This is another one of those movies that you might see at a film festival , but probably won't get picked up for distribution . Check it out on DVD if you 're really partial to someone involved in the project . Otherwise skip it .  
  OK I caught this film halfway through , but . oh . dear . god . it . sounds . like . they 're . all . reading . from . scripts . Especially that guy who is now in Teachers and the Book Group , although at least he has proved that he can act if he wants to ! ( the part where someone has a heart attack stands out as a bastion of bad film making both in terms of acting , scripting and general plausibility ) It quite clearly appears to be a cash-in on Human Traffic , but whilst that is not the best film ever , it is at least original and had actors whose delivery did not resemble that of earnest-yet-hopeless GCSE students trying to get a pass grade . Not so much as Human Traffic as a bit of a car crash !  
  This film has a special place in my heart as the worst movie I have ever seen . It is about as fun as doing hard manual labor with stomach cramps . The movie starts out bad ( I would rate the first few minutes of the film a 1/10 ) and then it get progressively worse , minute by minute . The only way to rate it at all would be some kind of abyssmal spiraling negative number that grows for ninety , long minutes . Unfunny is not a real word but it best describes the humor in this video . Somehow the video manages even to make cute , scantily clad females and sex look grotesque and distasteful . This movie is amazingly bad . I would say it would be better to be locked up with the TITANIC theme playing over and over and with Buscemi 's character from ESCAPE FROM LA droning on in your ear than to watch this movie . The sequels are not nearly as bad . If you have to rent a Troma film , get Tromeo and Juliette or Combat Shock . I would rather watch 5 Tony Little infomercials back to back than to see CLASS of NUKEM HIGH again . Don't get me wrong , it took some kind of criminal genius to make a movie this terrible and if ever a movie deserved an award for being awful , this is it .  
  I 'm only rating this film as a 3 out of pity because it attempts to be worthwhile . I love to praise a great movie and I 'm not biased toward " male " movies . Legally blonde was an excellent film . Georgia Rule on the other hand , was a disorganized , weak , poorly written , unrealistic example of movie making at its worst . by the end of the film I didn't care who was lying or if anything was resolved . The most important thing in a film is a good STORY . This story is weak and never develops ( just because the subject matter is deep , doesn't mean the story is good ) . A good story has dynamic characters . A dynamic character is one that experiences a major character change , and is primed for that change over the course of the movie . In Georgia Rule , the character changes were abrupt and undeveloped . Secondly , there were too many ATTEMPTED dynamic characters . Pulling off a really good dynamic character is a tough job and takes time ( you 've only got a couple hours in a movie ) . That means that too many attempted dynamic characters will get too little attention to their personal change . Even if I ignore the poorly written story , and the litter of weak dynamic characters , I can't even say I liked anyone . Every character was a mess . That 's fine if your 're writing American Beauty but not when you 're attempting a dramatic comedy . Georgia was a horrible mother , her daughter was a horrible mother and daughter , and Lohan was a horrible excuse for a human being ( no I 'm not cutting her any slack because she was molested , crap happens to everyone and we 're all responsible for our own actions ) . The " Dudley Do Right " Mormon kid should have had the guts not to compromise his religion and commitments .. and Simon , I mean seriously , what kind of guy lets a 17 year old girl who 's been molested just stay over occasionally ( unless he 's an actor or a politician ) . This movie is worth watching if you want to remind yourself what good movie making is NOT !  
  I have been searching for the right words to describe this film . At first I was inclined to simply skip to more significant matters , as the film does not rise to a level deserving comment . Yet , I stopped , puzzled as to how to describe such stuff and somewhat intrigued by the challenge presented by the question : " What can one say about such a film ? " Rubbish ? No , its not rubbish , rubbish can be recycled into something useful . Greenhouse gas ? No , its not greenhouse gas , greenhouse gases help plants grow large and healthy . Finally , I struck on " Not even bad , " a rework of the phrase " Not even wrong " used sometimes in theoretical physics to describe a theory that is hopelessly flawed and not even worthy of correction . That 's it then , Georgia Rule : Not even bad .  
  Georgia Rule has got to be one of - if not the worst movie I have ever seen in my life . The whole movie has a very surreal feel that made me gasp , " what ? " out loud at least 7-10 times throughout its grueling two hour course . Advertised in its trailer as a movie about three generations of women - Jane Fonda as the matriarch , Felicity Huffman as her daughter , and Lindsay Lohan as the rebellious , over - sexed , scantily clad grand-daughter , the viewer thinks this will be a cliché , light , chick-flick about growing up and coming together as a family . Talk about false advertisement at it worst . After many shots of animals doing " funny " things in the background of " pivotal " scenes and not to mention a whole five minutes focusing on an old woman who comes into a doctor 's office weekly to have her diaper changed , or the fact that this movie is actually about Lindsay Lohan 's character being sexually abused by her step-father , Georgia Rule creates its own genre of cinema : The ungrounded , horribly acted , inappropriate comedy dealing with extremely serious issues in the most awkward , surreal , strange way . If Garry Marshall wanted this movie to be a drama / comedy , then he should have watched The Royal Tenenbaums . Sideways . Junebug . And so on . And so on . The only way I feel I can get a reader to understand the horrific genre that Georgia Rule falls under is to create a hypothetical situation . Say that the movie , The 40 Year Old Virgin , was about the main character being celibate because he was sexually molested as a child . But instead of having the movie take a more dramatic turn , belly laughs and comedy would ensue , with all of the characters ' reactions being that of fake , lifeless , human beings pretending to care . Throw in a yellow parakeet , Dermot Mulroney as the flattest , most non-dimensional character that could have been cut completely out of this poorly written script , along with a male character who throws away all of his religious beliefs and morals to be with a trashy , too-tanned girl who shares none of the same interests as he , as well as an an unnecessary car chase scene , unreal moments of characters trying to relate to each other , and you 've got Georgia Rule . I found this movie to be an insult to any of those people out there who are struggling filmmakers , screenwriters , actors , editors , etc .. who have a lot more talent and aren't getting noticed . Don't see this movie : my rule . And if you must , get sufficiently drunk before hand .  
  Knowing how old a film is , ought to prepare the viewer for a few things , and , with those things in mind , perhaps the movie 'll be more tolerable . So it was when I watched Revolt of the Zombies . The heavy reliance on tedious dialogue and corny movements should be expected , as should the primitiveness ( or absence ) of special effects in those days . A great deal is asked from the imagination of the onlooker - maybe too much , in this case . And the plot isn't easy to follow : Some zombiefied southeast Asian soldiers in WWI performed very admirably . Although skeptical as to why , if true , the explanation should stay out of the wrong hands , so , off goes a group to archaeologically investigate . The key to long-distance hypnosis is learned by a member of the expedition , who uses it to , among other purposes , temporarily dispense with the beau of the gal for whom he has the hots . To prove his love for her , he gives up his hold on everybody , which he shouldn't have done ' cause , once they 're all unzombiefied , many want to kill him so that he 'll never control them again . Below average , even with precautionary forethought . Recommended for only the extremely patient .  
  Seriously , I absolutely love these old movies and their simplicity but I just watched this for the first time last night and it easily slotted itself into my bottom five of all time . Was this supposed to be about the love story or the zombies ? This movie was so bad that after it mercifully ended all I could do is laugh at how ridiculously bad it really was . Thankfully I 'm too anal to turn a movie off without seeing the entire thing or I wouldn't be able to brag about watching this all the way through in one sitting ! I like to think something positive can be said about anything in life so in keeping with that theory I will acknowledge this film 's most positive asset , it was very short for a full length film .  
  It 's not like I have overwhelmingly fond memories of Verhoeven 's original pants-down shocker - it always struck me as a glossy , well-made airport novel of a movie . Thrilling , sexy trash , but trash nonetheless . It was also a film that tapped into a certain sexual zeitgeist . After a decade of anti-sex AIDS-induced hysteria , a film about a wildly-sexual hotbod who thrill-kills to heighten her sexual pleasure was pretty enticing stuff . Basic Instinct 2 was always going to struggle to provide the same social relevance and immediacy , so the fact that it 's desperate attempts at raunchiness are so lame can sort-of be overlooked . All it really had to provide was that thin veneer of titillation and a mildly engaging story and all would have been watchable . That it resoundingly fails on so many levels , and in such a way to be a career nadir for everyone involved , is really quite extraordinary to watch . Let 's state the obvious for starters - Sharon Stone is too old for the part of sexual magnet Catherine Trammell . What was so photogenic thru Verhoeven 's lens looks like mutton dressed as lamb in the hands of gun-for-hire Michael Caton-Jones , who 's flat , drab colours and static camera render her undeniable beauty totally moot . I like Sharon Stone a lot , but if the first film launched her career , BI2 could kill it . She has no chemistry with stuffed-shirt David Morrissey - their only sex scene is embarrassing too watch . His dough-faced mamma 's boy of a character made me yearn for the swaggering , orange-skin machismo of Michael Douglas . Supporting turns by David Thewlis and Charlotte Rampling waste these fine actors on talky exposition scenes and cliché-heavy posturing . And what of the much-touted sexual shenanigans ? Poorly-lit , fleetingly-glimpsed , as utterly mainstream as an episode of Desperate Housewives - the European sensibilities that Verhoeven brought to the sexual content of the first film are sorely missed . Don't watch this film for carnal thrills - there are none and what there is is tragic . The film is , as a whole , convoluted to the point of utter confusion , boring and laughable . The last 40 minutes in particular , where you come to the realisation that the film is , in fact , not going to go anywhere of interest at all , are particularly gruelling and hilarious in equal measure . As a failed sequel , Basic Instinct 2 will come to occupy similar cinematic ground as Exorcist 2 The Heretic , Beyond The Poseidon Adventure and XX2 . As a vanity project , it rivals Battlefield Earth in its misconception . As a multi-million dollar piece of Hollywood film-making , it 's a travesty that will be hard to top as the years worst .  
  The only reason I watched the movie till the end was the " hope " to see something interesting . The movie is really bad and the performance of the girl it is really , really bad , honestly , I am not a movie critic neither an expert but you just need common sense to notice that this work it is incredibly bad . The first thing that came to my mind as soon as she started to talk was : " She has an affair with Willem Dafoe and he accepted to help her with the screenplay and appear in her movie since she is the brilliant director " .. surprise , surprise , next day after I watched the film I found out on internet that Giada Colagrande is his wife . Awful story and terrible performance .  
  The poster who called this " Plotless and pointless " literally took the words I would have used in my subject line . The only thing I 'd add is " passionless . " For a film made by a real life married couple and featuring lots of graphic sex scenes this movie manages to make what should be a sultry situation into one beyond ice cold . Dafoe and Colagrande look bored during the sex scenes , and the viewer might as well take a Valium and have done with it . Also , please , the women in the audience have seen WAY too many used tampons in their time , and any guy who is turned on by seeing Willem Dafoe pull a bloody tampon out of his wife 's vagina really needs to get therapy . I think the key to the film ( if there is one ) is the restaurant scene where a waiter explains to the perpetually sleepy-eyed Dafoe what a " deconstructed jambalaya " is . ( All the ingredients of the dish still separate rather than simmered together . ) This movie is a " deconstructed thriller " . All the elements are there : spooky , isolated house , dead spouse , creepy violins on the score , weirdo caretaker who comes and goes as he pleases , auto accident deaths and near deaths , characters with a secret past . Basically every thriller cliché you can think of , but NOTHING comes together . Everything just sits there and never meshes into a coherent plot or even an artsy mood piece . At the restaurant , Dafoe passes on the " deconstructed jambalaya " . Prospective renters of this mess would do well to leave this deconstructed thriller on the video store shelf .  
  Boston legal has turned its tail and is headed for the barn door and th pig slop it has created ! When this show first aired almost four season back it was a humorous slap at the legal system which all actors seem to take pride in portraying . It was funny , diversified , and to some extent factual . The characters portrayed were acceptable and to an extent real in their portrayals . The sexual comment and activity were limited and humorous . Julie Bowen is and was beautiful as in other series she participated but is now dragged to the lower depths of Media programming of sex and violence . Julie is an excellent actress and needs a more stable platform than this " production " . Rene Adjurdubois Is an excellent actor who has from the days of " Benson " to this production held his own in the field of entertainment , always showing the humor and respectful acting of the production . Captain Kirk " is " . Funny and humorous is Candace Bergan and is to be admired for her continuing in this production and is a good actress . James Spader , there is no doubt in his acting ability , however he should go back to his XX origins such as " Crash " as it appears he has much talent and inclination in that direction . We ask that this series be trashed as it already is and its really starting to smell !  
  This movie is one of the most awful movies ever made . How can Jon Bon Jovi play in a movie ? He is a singer not an actor , What ? Is he killing vampires with his guitar ? And what about the dreadful plot ? O my God this movie really sucks . In the end is the Queen of vampires played by the eternal vampire Arly Jover ( Blade ) surrounded by an army of vampires , but when the " fantastic " slayers arrive only 4 vampires are left ! What happened with the other 10-15 vampires ? They run out in the sun ? And what about the " Grand Finally " when Bon Jovi blows her head with a shotgun ? That 's really a " NOT " . In " Buffy the vampire Slayer " in 100 episodes not a single vampire is killed with A SHOTGUN ? This really is a lack of originality !  
  I 'll be honest - the reason I rented this movie was because I am a huge fan of Kyle Chandler 's ( most notably from Early Edition ) . Since he usually plays the good guy , I wanted to see him as in a different role ( out of curiosity ) . The plot itself also drew me in ; a wanna-be hitman ( Tony Greco - a . k . a . Mr . Chandler ) must kill a person at random before he is trusted with the life - or , rather , the death - of a witness who will testify against someone in " the family " . The movies was nothing like I expected . It was sick , I hated the end ( if you saw it , you 'd know why ) , and there were so many unnecessary parts . Basically - it was filthy , and made little sense . Yes , it was a mob movie , and yes the guns do go BOOM . But there 's more to a movie than that . This film acted as if it didn't have the time to go into detail - just deal with it and understand it . The acting really made up for it - James Belushi was pretty amusing as " The Rose " . Sheryl Lee made Angel seem as believable as she could get . She surprised me the most . And Kyle Chandler was equally convincing as an anxious newcomer to " the family " . If only the script did justice to the actors .  
  First I 'd like to excuse my bad English . I 'm not a HOSTEL-hardcore-fan , but I liked that movie nevertheless . Live Feed , however , SUCKED BIG TIME ! I have never seen a gore-movie with superb acting , but hey , who 's surprised ? The acting in Live Feed was .. well , not there ! I 've seen some commented this as it must have been a school project or something . Okey , but not by students in media or acting school . This was NO class at all ! And what about the story ? A really sad rip-off on Hostel . And what about the gore ? What about the psychopathic torture scenes that supposed to make your guts twist and leave you cold-sweating ? That was the most disappointing about the hole movie ! Short , quick and NO edge . More like an execution rather than a torture . Okey , there where buckets of blood , but it didn't even look real . The slaughtering and the violence reminded more of Braindead than Hostel or any of the Saw-movies . And Braindead was fun ! Okey , I laughed at Live Feed a couple of times , but that was more out of disappointment than out of sheer fun ! So instead of wasting 80 minutes by watching Live Feed , watch ANYTHING else !  
  About the worst movie in distribution right now ! I love zombie movies and saw this in the used rack so I thought why not ? Oh my god a shame to zombie movies and fans to the genre ! Whoever made this movie needs to put away your camcorder and go to film school ! There are so many gore hounds out there who have put time and effort into their films and they have something that this film doesn't dignity . I know it what it takes to make films and I 'm sure there was a lot of money and time spent in making Meat Market but none of that money and time went in to making it good . You need actors , a script , a real camera , invest in some books on how to make independent films . I don't know how you got a DVD release but whoever did that is either a really good friend or banging their head on the wall . In gore films it is quality not quantity , the effects are weak ! I was so angry that this is actually in stores and that I couldn't get my money back . Please if you have seen this film write here and put an end to shlock . I know I 'm being very harsh , I only had 10 lines so I 'm trying to get to the point .  
  I have to say I hated this movie . I don't like to say that because Gerard Butler is in it . About a half an hour of boring conversation , sorry to all who actually care about the plot , I started fast-forwarding to Gerry 's scenes . I really don't know the ending , I was that bored with it . If Gerry wasn't in it , I probably either done one of two things : fell asleep or turned it off , but Gerry is the bright light of this movie , as he is with most of his earlier movies . If you 're a fan of Gerry 's don't worry , he 's as adorable and precious as he always is , but if you actually want to watch the movie for the plot , good luck because you 'll need it , either that or lots of coffee or soda to keep you awake ! 4/10 .. and that 's just because the casting director had the sense to put Gerry in this movie , even though they had no idea of how to spell his name !  
  Well .. i was going to wait till this came out on video to see it , and i wish i had , I actually caught scary movie 2 on cable the other day , and it made me yearn for more of the same , what i got was AIRPLANE on CRACK .. i mean if you like Airplane or any other Leslie nielsen vehicles , then you 'll probably be in heaven , but if your used to the usually WAYANS COMEDY , then you will be dissapointed , there was alot more Eye candy in this one which will keep young hormone raged teenage boys happy , which is probably why it was a box office hit the first week it came out . I enjoyed scary movie 2 ten times more then this fodder , and part one 5 times as much . Odd that the better of the 3 is part 2 , but then again i always liked Halloween 2 better then the original as well .. maybe its just me . The funniest part of the movie has to be the way the Aliens Say Goodbye . But that wasnt worth the 11 dollars i spent to catch a matinee of this with my fiance . Save yourself cash and catch part 2 again on cable till this is released on Video tape , and then Rent it , dont buy it .  
  This was thought to be the flagship work of the open source community , something that would stand up and scream at the worlds media to take notice as we 're not stuck in the marketing trap with our options in producing fine work with open source tools . After the basic version download ( die hard fan here on a dial-up modem ) eventually got here I hit my first snag . Media Player , Mplayer Classic & winamp failed to open it on my xp box , and then Totem , xine & kaffeine failed to open it on my suse server . Mplayer managed to run it flawlessly . Going to be hard to spread the word about it if normal users cant even open it .. The Film . Beautiful soundtrack , superb lighting , masterful camera work and flawless texturing . Everything looked real . And then the two main characters moved .. and spoke .. And the movie died for me . Everything apart from the lip syncing and the actual animation of the two main characters ( except for Proog in the dancing scene ) looked fluid and totally alive . The two main characters were animated so poorly that at times i was wondering if there are any games on the market at the moment with cut-scenes that entail less realism than this . Any frame in the movie is fantastic .. as a frame , and the thing is great if neither actors are moving . I 'm so glad i haven't actually recommended this to anyone . I 'd ruin my reputation . Oh , and final fantasy had a more followable and cunningly devised plot . this movie would get 10 stars if it wasn't for the tragedy that sits right there on the screen .  
  I rented this film yesterday mostly due to the good-looking art and the summary given on the back of the jacket . After popping it into my DVD player I re-examined the jacket cover and even though I took the cover out of from the plastic viewer , I STILL could not read any of the production detail information about the film . This film is entitled Evil on the Jacket and had to locate it by going to Faith Films website to find out any linkage to it here on IMDb . The filming and special affects done in the film looked quite good .. THEN , a line-reading actor spoke . Oh dear .. this actor 's reading sounded like some pimple-faced high school jock whose voice just managed to change pitch , and no attempt given to go beyond reading the lines from the script . At first I thought I got a bad disc out of audio sync , then had to surmise it was a foreign film since I couldn't read the jacket .. English dialog dubbed . If they 'd casted the right person for dubbing the dialog , this film MIGHT have been decent . I gave it a chance of about 20 minutes before ejecting it when I discovered the bad line reader wasn't going to get killed off , but stay as the constant main fixture . Yes , it is THAT bad ! The jacket cover art and the art done in the film are great , so gave the one star , but minus 1,999,999 stars for the rotten dialog . I do not recommend this one !  
  SPOILERS THROUGHOUT : The Gettaway is mostly an action movie . And what action there is to ! Shootouts , chases , dumpsters and much much more . It stars Kim Bassenger and Alec Baldwin as the Mc Coy 's . This is a remake and I have not seen the original but really didn't care for this one at all although Bassenger and Baldwin have some nice screen chemistry . But the movie itself didn't do it for me . The Gettaway became really tiresome really quickly . The plot is overshadowed by one fight / chase after another and as the violence keeps piling up , Bassenger and Baldwin retain their great looks no matter what perils they maybe in . In fact , by the end of the movie they almost look BETTER then in the beginning . I don't think Bassenger 's eye makeup moves once during the whole picture . This isn't the worst movie I 've ever seen , certainly not , but it isn't very good and unless one is an action movie purist I can't see really enjoying this movie because there 's just not a lot here . The Gettaway isn't terribly original either , and goes every way from unnecessarily brutal to rather dull . It really could have been better I think . Bassenger and Baldwin give OK performances but they don't have a lot to do except get chased and run for their lives . Sometimes less is more , after seeing the same thing over and over again it gets stale . Didn't enjoy this one to much .  
  Tierney 's an authentic tough guy , but this movie misfire from normally competent RKO undercuts his impact at every turn . The script is about as plausible as OJ Simpson at a Ten Cmmandments dinner . Just count the times Tierney 's incredible car companions swallow one lame excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts . The old cliché about it " only happening in the movies " applies here in spades . Then there 's the guy playing the watchman , who appears to have wandered in from a boozy WC Fields comedy , ruining the menacing mood in the process . The static one-room sets don't help either , and neither does director Feist 's obvious lack of feel for the material . Then add a final car chase missing both imagination and pay-off , and the results are pretty flat . In fact the movie only picks up in the station-house scenes where hard-bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent-looking gas station attendants . Too bad that Tieney 's career never really gelled . I gather that was due largely to being as big a tough guy off-screen as on and getting in one sleazy scrape after another . His ice-cold manner and clarity of emotion remind me at times of Lee Marvin at his tough-guy best . Anyway this project might have worked as a radio play , but as a movie with a promising noir title , it 's a disappointment .  
  The most difficult thing about this movie is to say anything positive about it . The characters were stereotypical " white-trash " , the movie 's " plot " was stunted from the beginning , and the worst feature of this movie was that the nudity was so blatantly from body doubles it was funny . Regretfully , that was the only funny thing in the movie . Ms . Jenkins would be better served if in the future , she would refrain from using her life-story to " entertain " people . It was simply that bad . The one positive aspect of this movie ( this has nothing to do with the lack-of-quality of the film ) is that my brother shelled out the money for this stinker .  
  Williamson 's accent is tough to wade through . He speaks incredibly quickly , like he is in a rush to get through the lines . During the soliloquies he acts as if he is talking to someone , when he is supposed to be talking to himself . All that and his bald spot just annoyed me . He was just too old for this role . In reading other accounts of Williamson , maybe he got this role because he was mad and the director decided to do a bit of life-imitates-art or forced method acting . When the actors declare Hamlet mad you believe it ! Marianne Faithful is a stunning beauty and could botch the role of Ophelia and still get a pass . The set is dark and foreboding but it does look as if shot in a real castle especially the scenes in the tunnels / corridors where the dead king shines as a great light in the sky .  
  Honestly , I went to see the movie , not because of the actors , not because of the plot but because it was rated 17 here in Luxembourg and a movie has to be really brutal or pornographic to be put in this category . Believe me , being a movie-freak , I have seen quite a lot of brutal films in my lifetime ( Ichi the killer , Irreversible , Hellraiser ) but this movie was by far the most disturbing and brutal picture I have ever seen . The plot is plain stupid , the directing is awful , acting was mediocre even the music was a cheap copy of so-called " Horror Soundtracks " . There isn't a single intelligent aspect in the whole movie , and some of the scenes are really hard to stand . ( especially the scene , where you see the embryos in the glasses and hear the baby cries-horrible ) . I can't understand why the movie was rated 16 in Germany , where normally the criteria are real tough ( e . g . kill-bill ( brutal but it made fun of itself and had great allusions to Asian cinema and besides a magnificent directing ) even a movie like state of grace is rated 18 ) . No one can call this a Horror movie , because actually it was more about showing gore than about scaring the public ( Showing the " Creep 's " face in the middle of the movie was a very bad decision ) ; for me ( excuse my expression ) it is just one insane director living out his disturbing fantasies . In some scenes you see violence , that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot nor does it explain anything . The plot has holes and flaws , the dialog is boring , honestly I can't mention a single positive aspect of the movie except for the British and Scottish accent . If I had something to say , I would ban this movie from the theaters , I fully understand why none of the big production companies invested their money in this crap . I 'm looking forward to getting feedbacks to my thread and I 'd be happy to discuss about one or the other topic . " Livin ' the dream baby , livin ' the dream " David Aames  
  Creep - " Your journey terminates here . " Some very graphic scenes and .. well , yeah , that 's about all for this film . No real plot , no storyline . No likable characters , well , ' characters ' isn't correct considering you don't have a clue who anyone really is . I mean , they are being chased by some weird looking ' thing ' in the sewers ( who is this thing ? why is he there ? ) , that 's quite scary I guess , but do I really care ? No , I don't . Why don't I ? Because I don't have a clue who these people are and I don't know if I should want them to live or die . It 's one dimensional and relies upon gore and sound effects to scare you , which it rarely does . This film lacks any meaning , any purpose . It feels like I fell asleep and missed out the 45mins of build up . It jumps right into the action . Basically , some women and her friends get locked in the London Underground , get chased by a weird creature , then they eventually escape from it . Creep has its moments which make you jump , the art is good , the location is excellent and the sounds are OK , but that isn't what makes a decent horror film , so unfortunately all that goes to waste . It 's nothing new . Another predictable modern ' horror ' , where Kate ( the lead ' character ' ) consistently does the stupid " hey , I know you lot sitting at home think I should do the sensible thing in this situation , but , ooh no ! I 'm going to do the total opposite because I 'm a dumb blond " thing . I wish they wouldn't do that , it 's done so many times , it 's boring and gets predictable . In fact , I 'm pretty annoyed the silly woman didn't get stabbed by the , erm , grey alien-looking creature . " Your journey terminates here " is the films tag line . Well , Creeps journey terminates only a short while into the film . If you 've had a few beers , got a couple of mates back at yours , then sure , watch it by all means . But if you want something original and clever , avoid .  
  I was one of those " few Americans " that grew up with all of Gerry Andersen 's marvelous creations . Thunderbirds was a great series for the time and would have made a great action / adventure movie if only the writers could have figured out where to target it . I expected it to be a romp , but I did not expect it to aim at such a low age group . Like Lost in Space , this could have been both visually stunning and exciting . It should have focused on more action / adventure and the goal of the original series .. saving people in trouble . Instead , it focused on Alan saving the day instead of his brothers ( who were cast too young anyway vs . the original ) . The breakout part was Lady Penelope and Parker . I didn't care too much for the characters in the original , but I was grateful for them in the movie . They stole the show ! I always enjoyed Thunderbirds more for the high-tech than the stories , and even that did not get enough screen time as far as I was concerned . I would have enjoyed seeing more of the cool gadgets . But then , I 'm just a big kid .. ; )  
  To be honest , this film is another in a series of huge disappointments .. most of these so-called " masters of horror " films are only horrifying in terms of their sub-par effects and laughable story lines .. aside from Ron Perlman , everyone else in this film cannot act to save their life .. the gunshots sounded like someone was playing Bop-it under the boom mike or something , and looked completely unrealistic .. overall , this film is about as scary as Home Alone .. the only good masters are Cigarette Burns , Jennifer , and maybe Pelts .. I don't know how these directors can sleep at night knowing that they have ruined the very genre that some of them used to actually understand ..  
  SLIGHT SPOILERS ( but it doesn't matter anyway ) . An exercise in gobblygook of catastrophic proportions not even worthy of the l0 lines I need to put these remarks on the netwaves . This is the single worst episode of the Masters series to date and the first that qualifies for the defunct Mystery Science Theatre treatment . Even if it took me a full half hour to realize the intended ironic angle , it was still a very lame mess . Its sole value lies in the perspective that forces one to realize that in addition to gore and ugly masks the genre only succeeds when the classic cinematic notions of photography and lighting , dialogue and acting , editing and timing are put to use . Here they are absent and John Carpenter is no master . Period . And no trite analysis of the easy social comment herein will change that . Oddly , Carpenter never has been anything more than a B director , but at least such films as ' Fog ' and ' The Thing ' had terrific atmosphere ( the latter is one of my cult favorites ) . Abominable acting . Camera angles stuck in cement . Tensionless rhythm . Yet perhaps the single most obnoxious element of the episode is the storyline which of course JC cannot really be blamed for ( unless the writers were buddies of Cody . ) The initial two minute slo-mo of a girl running through a forest only to be nearly run over by a would be Scully-Mulder duo is the first and last thing that works in the film . But come on , a girl hurtling through a deserted woods to nowhere in particular in desperate need of an abortion fortuitously rendez-vous with the fender of a pair of ' women 's rights ' MDs whose clinic just happens to be at the end of the road around the corner . Oh , and I won't even nitpick about how the doc whips the accidentee into the car and speeds away at 0 to 60 in six seconds . Does wonders for possible broken ribs or concussion . Then things fall apart real quick . The vacuous dialogue " I just want to help you " , the interminably sluggish back and forth at the gate , grandiose battle tactics like cutting the telephone line ( in the age of cell phones ? ) followed by the the shoot-out : a born-again Ramboesque clinic director vs Ron Perlman and the high school bullpen out for a few kicks at Easter break . Another lovely line : " So what are we going to do ? " from the kid who had just been sitting on a pile of assault rifles in the back of the van . Er , no it isn't yet pheasant season . So who needs those teen boys anyway . What about the good old tried and true method of the lone lunatic who bashes his way through the gate with his all-American SUV ? As for the exchange of bullets scenes themselves , the cuts here were as stiff as the staccato of a DC comics strip . All that was lacking were the Wham , Bam , and Whiz of the balloon titles . And all to the tune of a soundtrack worthy of an old Mannix episode . At one point we learn that Daddy isn't really the daddy , but at this point we haven't been led to care much any more either . This story 's single source of drama is the conflict between the pro-life father and his pregnant daughter who is only thankful she 's not having twins . Yet there is not a single scene , flashback or not , where they are actually ever found together . They remain mere abstractions to each other throughout . With the exception of the gatekeeper every single one of the characters is absolutely dislikeable . Bland , hysterical , dull-headed , macho . As perfectly flat as human wallpaper can be . None of the doctors seem to have anything medical about them . And there 's that bickering Dad who rails at his pregnant daughter as though he himself were the stressed out boyfriend . He fortunately got his . There are two great MST-worthy comic moments : the gusher when Angelica 's plumbing goes out and later the new-born lobster with a glued on baby 's head . Also cute was Angelica 's rugby ball belly before she finally popped the right-to-life little monster from Hell . As for that audacious male abortion scene .. well , they should have retained Miike 's episode and banned this one instead . In short , a 3rd rate Rosemary 's Baby meets Alien set on the turf of a M.A.S.H. episode . This stinker alone , appreciable only to today 's permissive under-16 generation , will assure as someone else said here , that this series will not be renewed for a third season . A real shame , since there have been a number of brilliant productions , including such really decent spoofs as Dante 's ' Homecoming ' or McKee 's deliciously quirky ' Sick Girl ' . Not to mention the superb imagery of Malone 's ' Fairhaired Child ' . Sorry John Carpenter , I believe your directing days are over . It 's time to run for President .  
  * MANY MANY SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW * This movie was horrible . I am a huge baseball fan so I thought I 'd watch it , and I was very disappointed . It started out okay .. When I saw the bad influence DeNiro had on his young son , I was hoping that he would become a better father throughout the movie or something . Anyways , at the beginning it seemed as if DeNiro was supposed to be the protagonist . He was the only one that believed in Bobby , and he had his adorable son that he was losing custody of , which gave me a reason to feel bad for him . He wanted to help Bobby by talking to Primo , when out of absolutely nowhere he brutally stabs Primo to death .. Not to mention that sketchy reoccurring song " I WANT TO * YOU ! " at random unfitting moments . Later , when DeNiro saves Bobby 's son from drowning , I was hoping that the movie could redeem itself .. He could forgive himself for killing Primo if he saved Bobby 's son . But of course this is far beyond the depth of the movie , because all he cares about is getting CREDIT for the murder , and does so by stealing Bobby 's son , car , and dog and holding them hostage - Bobby just has to hit a home run and announce that DeNiro is a " true fan " while displaying a picture of him biting a knife . Now we get to the completely unrealistic scene at the end .. It is pouring like hell and we are expected to believe that the game hasn't been called . Then DeNiro somehow magically appears on the field in an umpire suit and calls Bobby out at home , proceeding to pull out his knife and start stabbing everyone that runs onto the field . There are seemingly no officers on the field ( but the police are on their way ) , so DeNiro steps on the mound and prepares to pitch a knife to Bobby when he gets shot to death . But don't worry , this cheerful and pleasant movie has a happy ending , because Bobby find his son . This is NOT a sports movie . It is NOT about a fan . As far as I know , fans are not rabid psychopaths that threaten , rob , and throw knives at their admirees . This is likely to be the sickest movie I will ever see in my life . The plot was shallow , the soundtrack sucked , the movie had no purpose whatsoever . I warn you not to waste your time on this disgusting excuse for a film .  
  Yikes , it was definitely one of those sleepless nights where I surfed the channels and bumped into this stinker of a movie . For some of the names in the cast , I 'd expect a much better movie . I 'm almost embarrassed to see Oscar Winner F . Murray Abraham being reduced to such a horrible part . I hope the money was worth it . And the students , they talked about fencing like they were talking about survival in a war or through a horrible disaster . I mean , I 've fenced , it 's a fun sport , but I 've never been that intense . The only reason I even watched this entire movie was because the remote fell under the sofa and I was too lazy to get it back .  
  Once upon a time in the mid 1990s I used to write for DOCTOR WHO fanzines and the whole of fandom was holding its breathe about the new American produced DOCTOR WHO TVM . As soon as it was announced that the Doctor ` s arch enemy the Master was going to be played by Eric Roberts everyone scratched their heads and exclaimed " Who is Eric Roberts ? " . I should point out this was before the IMDB came online when all you had to do was type in a name into this website to their resume , but one helpful soul wrote into a publication I wrote for to explain that Eric Roberts was best known for a role where he starred opposite F Murray Abraham , the film was called BY THE SWORD and was about a fencing school . Actually looking back now Roberts is best known for THE POPE OF GREENWICH VILLAGE and RUNAWAY TRAIN but that didn ` t stop the person putting the boot into both Roberts and BY THE SWORD and his mind was made up that this American Master with his southern drawl was going to a debacle . Strangely most fans were furious about Roberts playing the Master but after they saw the DOCTOR WHO TVM a great many fans ( Myself among them ) thought Roberts performance was the best thing about the disappointing American production Yeah I ` m digressing but BY THE SWORD was a film that I wanted to see simply because it was the first time I ` d heard the name of Eric Roberts but I didn ` t get the chance to see it untill this weekend and I was fairly disappointed with it . I know nothing about fencing ( Everyone else on this page seems duty bound to mention if they fence or not . I don ` t fence ) so I don ` t know how accurate it all is , but as mentioned the film feels somewhat anachronistic even if you saw it on its release in 1991 , the hairstyles seem a few years out of date along with its mixed teenage cast doing a little dance routine that makes you wonder if it wouldn ` t have worked a lot better if it ` d had been produced by Jerry Bruckheimer in the mid 1980s . You could argue this would have meant the relationship between Max Suba and Alexander Villard being off centre for most of the film but I wasn ` t convinced about their love / hate relationship and Abraham and Roberts have given much better performances before and since BY THE SWORD  
  The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael is bad film in every way . The script , the dreary pace , the lack of depth in any character , the pointless sub-plots , the dreadful acting , the needless climax all make this possibly the worst film I 've ever seen . I found nothing likable , enjoyable or intellectually stimulating in any way . I imagine the film makers thought they were making something clever and dark , with its moody lighting , long protracted silences and vaguely haunting classical soundtrack . If so , they failed utterly . It just bored me , and I wish I had never watched it . Avoid at all costs .  
  Where was his critique of democratic administrations as well as republican ones ? After all he did serve for 17 + years in a body of government where his influence was unwaivering . Oh I forgot about the 8 years he was the 2nd in command of the most Powerful nation on Earth . The film is happy to show shots of a young Senator Gore asking why a NASA scientist was forced to change a conclusion in his scientific paper , but fails to ask about the complicity of Clinton / Gore in global warming . Probably too close to an election year , or maybe it would hurt the chances for Hillary in ' 08 . Either way he 's a political coward and party man to the bitter end . He offers no criticism of consumerism , no criticism of capitalism , no way to is the history of the industrial development which has led us to this point in time In the end this film was much more about Mr . Gore himself than about any real problems our environment faces . Mr . Gore if you really wanted to make a campaign film - shorten it & call it what it really is .  
  I really did like this show , once upon a time . That is , until I realized all the faults in it . It 's so unrealistic . I know it 's fiction , but it isn't even the slightest bit believable . Here 's why . * Spoilers ahead folks .. * Are we really supposed to believe that a kid like Yugi would be descended from a Pharaoh of ancient Egypt ? C'mon ! He 's the biggest nerd on the face of the Earth . And what 's up with the Pharaoh ( a . k . a . Atem and / or Yami 's ) hair ? Last I checked , Pharaohs were shaved ( except for a small bit of hair atop the head ) and wore fancy hats . And , are we supposed to be convinced that an evil wealthy boy genius , named Seto Kaiba , can legally run a successful business while still having time to go to a shoddy little school like ' Domino High ' ? Puh-leeze ! First off , he 'd have to legally be an adult to run a company . And that would make him not really all too much of a boy genius , since he 'd be the only adult in his class . And second off , why would he attend a school like ' Domino High ' , when his business is clearly successful enough for him to attend a fancy snobbish academy ? Plus , the side plots with his little brother are so sappy and lame . Every time you turn around , that kid 's been kidnapped by goons for the baddie . * yawn * Nothing new , nothing new . Joey is the poor kid , who lives with a good-for-nothing father . It says that Joey earns all the money to attend his school , because his father 's an alcoholic , but you never once see Joey do anything that resembles work . He doesn't even mention work . And his sister Serenity is a complete moron . Why would she choose a snob like Duke ( who dressed her brother in a dog costume and publicly humiliated him on television ) over a nice guy like Tristan ? Is she really that clueless ? Various characters throughout the show , get possessed by demonic forces , get their souls stolen by demonic forces , and fall prey to mental illness . ( Oh , that 's child-safe , NOT . ) Tea is the typical girl-next-door type , whose only purpose is to be Yugi / Yami 's girlfriend . And while she has some cool points to her , she just doesn't have enough time to shine as a main character . The animation is simply awful . All the characters look sickly and anorexic . The perspectives are terrible ( especially when they do close-ups of somebody 's hand ) and the colors look good , but not stellar . But the worst plot hole to the series was the fact that Yami says that his Millennium Puzzle can send souls back to their bodies . If this was so , how come he didn't save Yugi 's Grandpa in the first place , when Pegasus stole his soul , and save himself the trouble of getting it back ? All it really is , is a commercial for itself . The only plus side to it is " Yu-Gi-Oh : The Abridged Series " by LittleKuriboh . Please . Do something more worthwhile . Like , watch the Abridged version . 1/10  
  A friend of mine was in the cast as a FEDS agent ( a non-speaking part , as I recall ) . He brought it over on DVD so I could see it . It was " interesting " , but very much felt like an amateur film . A well made amateur film , though . Really boring and poorly written . It was probably fun to make and be involved in , but it definitely didn't deserve any kind of wide release . Maybe in Omaha they 'd enjoy it , but this California girl was bored and honestly kind of embarrassed for my friend 's involvement . If this film maker has made or makes any more films , he really should try to have a really interesting story line , and GOOD actors . I 'm sure this was a great learning tool for them . I wish them luck in the future , and hope they can improve their film making .  
  This movie had the potential to be a decent horror movie . The main character was decently done and I felt sorry for him and there was a decent amount of backstory . HOWEVER , everything else sucks . The director , Emmanuel , is quite incompetent at film-making . He uses some of the most idiotic shots ever . - a couple of random sequences of random images dispersed throughout the film . I don't know if he tried to be deep and intelligent and poetic but he wasn't . It was stupid . Random shots of the trailer the main character lived in , random buildings , random pan shots of buildings , random cat which walks away . WTF ? And clouds . Lots of gloomy dark clouds . - he really liked this technique of having a scene cut up into different shots rather than being just one continuous shot . EX : Guy is trying to light his weed and the camera circles around him . Instead of just one shot , he edits it into like 10 different shots so its really EDGY ! and HIP ! and SMART ! stupid . The acting is horrible but it 's what makes the movie so funny . And the scarecrow is a gymnast cause he flips and spins and twirls all the time . And some of the deaths could have been better . You expect the main bully to have a long well built up death but nope . A simple corncob in the ear . The love interest was hot . Voluptuous . Which is why this movie gets a 2 .  
  Recap : Ron is about to marry Mel . They are deeply and love and certain they are perfect for each other even though they met just a few months ago . Todd , Ron 's brother in law to be is not so happy . He is afraid the marriage is a threat to his cushy job in the family business and decides to arrange Ron 's bachelor party . But his real plan is to put Ron in a compromising situation , get evidence and break Ron and Mel up . Comments : Supposed to be a sequel to a comedy classic but it isn't funny at all . It is mostly a pubertal show and a juvenile excuse to show scantily clad women . Actually , in a way , it is almost impressive have many you can put in there , because they are everywhere . Unfortunately that is also one of the signs of a movie that can't support itself . It simply isn't good enough . It has three redeeming points though , or actually three actors that is worth a better script than this . It is lead actor Josh Cooke who actually manages to give an impression of some common sense . Sara Foster I know has more talent than to do movies like this , and Emanuelle Vaugier seem to have a lot more talent than this movie . What is suspiciously absent are good jokes . Actually , bad jokes are rather scarce too . It just isn't funny . 3/10  
  I 've no idea what dimwit from San Francisco came up with this stupid plot , but apparently they need to get off whatever drugs they are taking and put their analyst on danger money - NOW . Yeah , this is a plausible story , if you regard the alien abduction sequence in " Life of Brian " as plausible . This film is little more than a leftist pipedream . Had the US and USSR give up nuclear weapons , the result would 've been to eliminate the only real obstacle that kept the two from engaging in a war . Bad as Korea , Vietnam and other wars of the era were , they were " proxy wars " fought to keep the superpowers from a direct engagement . This film makes me think about how realistic it was when some group of high school kids would go on a hunger strike against nuclear proliferation . As if someone would say " Mr . President , some kids at Drastic High are not eating ! " and Ronald Reagan would reply " My God ! I 'd better revise my Defense policy ! " Right . Like this film ? Wouldn't it be better if the Soviet Union would 've collapsed because they could not support their massive arms build .. wait , that happened !  
  This was among the STUPIDEST and PREACHIEST of the anti-nuke films out of the 1980s . The idea that a kid and a basketball star could " change the world " is pretty far-fetched , given how many " children 's peace marches " and " celebrity protests " there were and ARE . But the idea that the Soviet Union would agree to a TOTAL nuclear disarmament , because some apparatchik kids learned of a " silent protest " in the West , is ludicrous . What ended the Cold War ? America 's tough , dare I say " Reaganesque " stance and the internal failures of socialism . It was NOT the peace marches , the " die-ins " or films like " Amazing Grace & Chuck " , " Miracle Mile " , or " Testament " .  
  The Good Earth follows the life a slave girl and a poor farmer in China . The movie is based on the novel by Pearl S . Buck . The story is great , but I hated that they decided to cast Anglos in the lead roles . Walter Connolly is laughable as the farmer 's father . He has such a heavy American accent , as do most of the lead actors , that I could not bear listening to him speak . It is a shame that Hollywood could not get past their racist beliefs to cast Asians in the lead roles . To take Anglos and make them look like Chinese is akin to Anglos putting shoe polish on their faces to play African-Americans .  
  This is the kind of movie i fear the most . Arrogant and Irresponsible , it presents a sketch of the colombian conflict so cliched and dumb it represents an insult to all Colombian people . The performances are godawul , from Grisales ( her naked scene is absolutely pitiful ) , to Bejarano , to Fanny Mickey ( who looks right out of a Tim Burton nightmare ) , to Díaz , who makes a notable effort to bring life to a character so one-dimensional , so cliched and so badly written all he´s left to work with is a mustache . Not to mention the gratuitous ending , a gore fest so cheesy that it would make Ed Wood cringe . It fails in all ways , cinematography , art direction , costumes , makeup , editing , and most of all directing , Jorge Alí Triana has always been a lousy filmmaker but at least his previous movies had some dignity . I can't say anything good about this waste of money , except that i hope Colombian filmmakers learn a lesson about honesty , integrity and responsability from this mean-intended fiasco .  
  The only reason I rented this was because of the article in Fangoria Magazine . The article made this film look interesting . Well , it isn't . This was a very boring , amateurishly written and directed movie . All the actors in this movie are awful , except Faye Dunaway , who is always a joy to watch . But too much time was focused on Gina Phillips and her ridiculous encounters with ravens and Duilio Marzio . Marzio has such a thick Argentinean accent , you can only understand every couple of words he says . Also on hand is Nicholas Pauls , who plays the ultra-bland love interest to Gina Phillips . The bottom line : this movie is not scary . There is only one good scene and that is the last five to ten minutes of the movie . I would have given this one star , but I gave it three just because I like Faye Dunaway so much . But even she wasn't that great in this .  
  One : Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason , two great comics turned into saps for a bratty kid . They 've both sold themselves out in this one , worse than Pryor 's character . Two : Horrible , overly sentimental script that could have been used in a Harold Lloyd movie its so cliched . Three : Choice of a black actor as the toy ; the racial subtext of this is unbearable , as its never addressed . There 's no message here , Pryor 's part could have been played by any comedic actor . Four : That kid .. I wish I could go back in time and prevent him from ever acting .. that would mean movies like this one and Kid Co . might not have been made .. and my childhood would have been free of their mind-warping power . So if you want to watch a couple of great comics defile themselves in a sickly sweet kiddie flick , go ahead . If you want to see them in something good , see Pryor 's old standup act and Gleason in something better , like the Honeymooners .  
  The films of UPA are surprisingly well rated on IMDb despite the fact that the animation quality is light-years behind that of Looney Toons , Disney and MGM at their prime . Sadly , due to rising costs in making pretty cartoons with high frame-rates and lovely backgrounds , the UPA style ( which debuted about 1950 ) began to dominate in the late 50s and 60s . After all , the films were dirt cheap to make and they 'd received several Oscars to " prove " that the cartoons were now mainstream . So as a result , lousy animation was becoming the norm and this trend wasn't reversed until the 1980s . This UPA film is one of the early ones . The characters are very simply drawn ( any simpler and they would have used stick figures ) and the backgrounds were ugly-simple line drawings with colors added in a very slap-dash manner ( often with a sponge and rarely completely filling the items ) . As for the story , it 's a jive story with a strong jazz style attitude . Some will love this , others will just find it very , very loud . It 's the traditional " Frankie and Johnny " story and because of the shootings and all , it 's probably not a great film for the kids . Heck , because of the animation and jazz , it 's not a particularly good film for me , either ! Some will read my review and no doubt think I am a crank ( which I am , to a degree ) . However , I love animated films and a little of this minimalistic UPA style goes a very , very long way and you can't seriously consider them great works of art-just very , very quickly made cartoons . Ignore the Oscars and try watching some classic cartoons or something-anything else !  
  This was far and away the worst movie i 've ever seen in my entire life . It was slow , boring , not scary , not funny , not dramatic , not entertaining . Sarah Michelle Gellar was up to her old playbook of empty expressions of fright and shock . She couldn't sell her character nor could anyone else in the picture . For those who thought the Grudge was ' kind of alright ' then don't go see this unless you get enjoyment out of wasting your time and your life . I saw this movie for free by the way so I don't want this to come across as a rant from a guy that lost 8 bucks on a terrible movie . It was free , it still sucked , I hated it . Avoid .  
  SOME NOT-SO-SPOILY SPOILERS AHEAD Why do people , when they are disoriented or sick or scared at a club , cut through the middle of the crowded dance floor on their way to the bathroom ? Who in their right mind would hide under a bed when someone breaks into their room ? How often do you knock on a stranger 's door and when they don't IMMEDIATELY answer , you open the door , walk in , shout a few hello 's and then start going through their stuff ? If you were being pursued by someone you just discovered was a murderer , what would you do ? Quietly sneak off and hide under a wooden platform or among metal implements ? Run , quietly of course , to a ratty old barn or other decrepit structure ? I could be talking about almost any thriller that 's come out in the last few years , but since this is the " The Return " page , obviously I 'm talking about " The Return . " I saw it free because I work at a movie theater and make a point of screening all the " scary " movies . I thought this one was tolerable .. aside from the well-worn clichés . Sarah Michelle Gellar is really drab and looks kind of " Huh ? " through most of the film . The details of the plot are slowly given out as the movie progresses and it 's almost enough to make it interesting except there wasn't enough explanation as it moved on and so I was almost lost until the last 2/3 of it . If you 're a die-hard thriller fan , it 's worth seeing at least once . If there 's nothing better at the theater and you really want to watch a movie , eh , I guess it 's worth a matinée ticket . If you thought the trailer made it look like an interesting movie and you can't wait .. wait .  
  Imagine The Big Chill with a cast of twenty-somethings whose characters are all unlikable , and an iguana-like man-lizard chasing them around and you have an idea of the foolishness herein . On the positive side , the movie does not skimp on showing the monster . There 's no peek-a-boo shots , or nighttime scenes where you have to imagine what he looks like ; he 's right out there folks . Unfortunately , the design and construction aren't that inspired . A little bit of mystery might have helped . Mind you , I 've seen far worse , but if you 're going to have him out on full display for a lot of the flick , your monster better look damn good . Spoiler Ahead ! Oh , and there 's a twist ending involving the supposedly dead brother that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever . This came as no surprise given the shoddy writing of the script . As for the acting ; well let 's just say it wasn't painfully bad , but I don't expect we 'll be seeing many of these kids in future cinematic outings . Gore quotient : 2 out of 5 ; Nudity quotient : 1 out of 5 ; Intelligence quotient : Negligible  
  Well , what can it be said about this disaster ? I watched it because it aired on cable . I regret for wasting my time but at least I didn't waste money . The creature is the cheesiest you can get ! Please , you need to be very generous not to get angered by the CHEAP Halloween costume . Oh well , there are also displays of horrible acting , f / x , and dialogues . The confrontation with the creature is unbelievable , you can't get a more pathetic scene . This is the worst you can get from direct to video flicks . " Creature Unknown " makes FULL MOON PICTURES movies look like " Halloween " . Avoid this one at all costs , please . The only " positive " thing about this trash are the sexy women .  
  I have seen bad movies before , but this one takes the " Worst Movie of a Lifetime " award by far ! Anthony Hopkins has to be completely mentally ill to have his name attached to this one - anywhere ! I will never see another movie with him in it , directing it , etc . , etc . ! I can't believe the other actors & actresses that I liked , ( in this picture ) , that stooped so low to be a part of this disaster ! There must be some great drugs out there ! For anyone to not be embarrassed to be a part of such a film , is beyond me ! Save your money on this one ! HUGE FLOP from beginning to end ! Shame on you Mr . Hopkins ! Also , shame on Christian Slater ! I can't believe you put your reputations on the line for this one !  
  I would rather have 20 root canals than go through this film again . The Prince of Annoying , Myles Berkowitz , has wasted nearly two hours of my life with this piece of cynical pseudo-cool . The only amusing thing in this whole mess is Mr . Samaha 's obnoxious off camera patter about tits and ass . Berkowitz takes a great concept and grinds it into the dust . It is choppy and badly done , in an apparent effort to make it seem edgy or funny . It is neither . I seldom feel that a movie was a waste of film ( or tape ) , but this one qualifies for that distinction . If a date suggests seeing this film , run .  
  If I could give this film a real rating , it would likely be in the minus numbers . While I respect the fact that somebody has to keep making these terrible " horror " films , seriously , people , buying a ticket for this film is a waste of money you could be spending on something far more worth your time . Despite it being a horror film , there is nothing scary about it , unless the idea of seeing how many horror cliché 's you can fit in one movie scares you . If the rating had been higher , it probably would have made for a better film in the long run . Whoever made this version of " Prom Night " , you screwed up . The actors could probably have done a decent job if it weren't for the questionable scripting . This was a terrible waste of a cinema trip . I 'd sooner go and see " One Missed Call " again , at least that had some plot .  
  You can tell a Lew Grade production a mile off  distinctly British in style ; epic in conception ; peopled by international all-star casts ; usually set in exotic climes . It 's a formula that Grade and his company ITC employed throughout the 70s into the early 80s , resulting in titles like The Eagle Has Landed , Firepower , and Raise The Titanic ! In 1977 Grade produced March Or Die , a remarkably old-fashioned Foreign Legion adventure that models all the characteristics mentioned above . Directed by the usually dependable Dick Richards  who helmed the acclaimed Farewell My Lovely just a couple years earlier - March Or Die is an unfortunate disappointment . A company of Foreign Legionnaires led by the harsh disciplinarian General Foster ( Gene Hackman ) is sent to Morocco shortly after World War 1 . Their mission is to protect an archaeological party fronted by the dedicated Francois Marneau ( Max Von Sydow ) . The archaeologists are carrying out an excavation at the ancient city of Erfoud , but fear an attack from Arab tribesmen following the decimation of an earlier archaeological group . Foster is not happy with the assignment  he does not consider historical artifacts worthy of his men risking their lives . This creates ongoing tension between himself and Marneau , who believes that the legionnaires should sacrifice their lives to make the excavation possible . The problems heighten when a beautiful woman named Simone Picard ( Catherine Deneuve ) tags along with the legionnaires . She is hoping to find out what happened to her father , a historian abducted by the Arabs when they wiped out the first archaeological team . Her presence arouses desires amongst the legionnaires , none more so than gypsy thief Marco Segrain ( Terence Hill ) , a charming and courageous rogue who initially shows indifference towards his legionnaire colleagues but gradually grows in stature . Things climax with a huge battle at Erfoud , with swarms of united Arab tribes charging against the handful of legionnaires as they desperately try to defend their lives . On paper the star duo of Gene Hackman and Terence Hill seem a mismatch  Hackman is the heavyweight Oscar-winning character actor , Hill the handsome but limited Italian heart-throb from numerous low budget spaghetti westerns . One expects Hackman to act his counterpart off the screen . Yet , bizarrely , it is Hackman who gives the weak and uninvolving performance , while Hill raises his game to surprisingly high levels . The film is attractively shot on desert locations , but the pacing is awfully slow and few of the characters are worth caring for . Maurice Jarre 's music is uncommonly flat too  very disappointing from the guy who gave us the Lawrence Of Arabia score . It is remarkable that anyone had the nerve to try an old-fashioned adventure of this type in the 70s ( it was a genre that peaked in the 30s , and had been all but forgotten during the intervening decades ) . Sadly , the gamble doesn't really pay off  this homage to the legionnaire flicks of old becomes more of a plod than a march .  
  I totally disagreed with those comments which said this is a good movie . This is a totally SUCKED movie . I mean SUCKED - S.U.C.K.E.D. The story development is strange . Mia Kirshner changed from an innocent girl to a party-fun seeking chick for no convincing reasons at all . In addition , all the actresses looked way too old for being college students - College students looked like about 30 years old - you figure out the rest . I watched only about first ten minutes and started fast forwarding to look for sex scenes . all the sex scenes are lame , hasty and , most importantly , no frontal at all . All the sex scenes are laughable , considering how many clothes they had on . Do yourself a favor - put it down and save yourself a few bucks . Conclusion : Story - 0 , Sex - 0 , Acting - 0 , Score - 0 out 10 .  
  Even if it were remotely funny , this mouldy waxwork of a film would still be soberingly disrespectful . Stopping just short of digging up the boys ' corpses and re-enacting ' Weekend At Bernie 's '  but only just  producer Larry Harmon and the director of the frickin ' ' Ernest ' films use holding the copyright as an excuse to crap all over Stan and Ollie 's legacy . Gailard Sartain does a fair Ollie impersonation but Bronson Pinchot wouldn't reach tenth place in a Stan lookalike contest ; even if they were both spot on the film would be no less detestable . The less said about the surrounding catastrophe the better . Makes ' Utopia ' look like a dignified swan song .  
  If you have seen the Sholay of 1975 , Don't watch this movie . If you have NOT seen the Sholay of 1975 , Go WATCH IT . But do not watch this movie . This movie has all the ingredients that could possibly have gone wrong with making a remake of Sholay . Amitabh ' Babban ' Bachchan plays the role of a psycho villain to the best ( Probably the only 40 mins of the reel that shouldn't be burnt ) . If you remove the rest of the movie and just watch amitabh play around with his character , it would still be worth a watch . But as Insp . Narsimha , Mohanlal doesn't do justice to his talent . Ajay Devgan ( Heero ) is extremely mundane and the only reason i think , they cast Prashant Raj in the role of Raj is because he has a striking resemblance to Amitabh of his young days . Sushmita Sen carries herself well , with grace and make-up . But the award for the " WORST performance and any role till date " must go to Nisha Kothari . She manages to degrade her acting to such levels that even high-school drama would would outshine her performance . If you have a mortal enemy , take him to this movie . : )  
  I 'm 47 years old and I 've spent as much of my life as I can remember , a fan of horror and sci-fi films . Be they silent , black and white , no budget or big budget , there are very few of them that I can't find something to like about . That said , I 'll give this movie credit for good gore and creature effects but that 's all . This is a case of effects over story . Truth is we live in a time where there is very little left that hasn't been seen in a horror film . Therefor for a film of any kind to really entertain it must have a good , original story . A good story can overcome poor effects and bad acting but a bad story with good acting and good effects is still a bad movie . This movie doesn't even have good acting , only good effects . So unless you can only about the gore , pass this one up .  
  The Fluffer may have strong elements of porn industry truth to it - but that doesn't make up for the fact that it 's pretty shabbily directed and acted - and with a very mediocre script . B grade from start to the exceedingly drawn out finish . It would be embarassing to think of the general public being offered this piece as an example of state of the art gay film making . Hopefully it has a limited life in the gay film festival circuit and is allowed to die a natural death on video . This film will open the Queer Film Weekend in Brisbane on April 10 , 2002 . I think its success there will be strongly influenced by the amount of alcohol consumed in the preceding cocktail party - they 're gonna need it .  
  This was god awful . The story was all over the place and more often than not I was confused because of horrible editing . I felt no sympathy for anyone because their characters were not developed enough . They were extremely superficial people with no dimension . Cheesy , cheesy stereotypes with subplots that went nowhere . The stripper chick was just a distraction , even if she was decent looking . I don't know what this was attempting to be , but how shocked was I when they showed this trash on Sundance ? I almost cancelled my subscription . You 'd think a channel like that would show more quality films . There are much , much better gay and lesbian themed films out there . " The Celluloid Closet " is an excellent documentary . I thoroughly enjoyed " Wigstock : The Movie " . I 'm sure there are others that have slipped my mind at the moment , but what I 'm trying to say is that this just wasn't worth it . If you catch it on TV , ok , but otherwise don't bother . There were maybe three or four shots that looked really nice ( sad I can count them on one hand ) , otherwise the cinematography was pretty crappy as well . The lighting was way off in a lot of places . I think some of the effects were used to try and add to something that just had practically nothing going for it . I can't deny Johnny Rebel is pretty hot ( without the blond hair of course ) . Too bad his acting did nothing for me . Stick with real porn , buddy . 3/10 .  
  City girl Meg Tilly receives a horrifying phone call from her mother and , understandably shaken , returns home to her family 's rural digs , only to be faced with a mystery : why are all the homespun residents acting out in bizarre and unsettling ways ? Radiation thriller , with barely a nod to ecology , has small town residents going berserk , which ( laughably ) includes two women gazing at each other with desire in a public place and Tim Matheson receiving oral attention from a girl on an office bench . The picture is too silly for words , wasting Tilly 's wistfulness and quiet intensity on trash while forcing itself into a corner it can't possibly hope to get out of . Some of the cinematography by Thomas Del Ruth is good ( particularly a fire sequence set inside a garage ) , though he is let down by the scrappy editing-and a fairly bathetic finale . Simplistic screenplay has nary a surprise nor a shred of originality up its sleeve . * 1/2 from *  
  I wanted to see it because of two reasons . One , it was the remake of High Sierra with Bogart , two , the Bogart part was played by Jack Palance , whom can play dramatic roles with some subtility , as in The Big Knife . But now I wonder why they decided to shoot this remake . The film follows the same plot as Hig Sierra ; only here , the actors don't care , the director is lost in his thoughts , and who knows what the producer was thinking . Jack Palance is getting bored looking at Shelley Winters and Shelley Winters is asking herself what she 's doing in this film . I don't even want to compare her to Ida Lupino in the same role . And of course , they had to use the dog story again ! They surely could have come up with some different ideas . Perhaps the color makes it nice to see the same location where they shot High Sierra , but that definitely doesn't add any quality to the film . It 's a waste of time if you 've seen High Sierra before . Otherwise , why not see a pseudo-film noir . As for me , I 'd rather die than see it one more time ..  
  So , back when Herbie made his first appearance , I was perfectly happy watching Dean Jones mug away . I only wanted to be entertained for a few hours and eat overly buttered popcorn . Now , unfortunately , I have expectations of a riveting / delightful story whenever I watch a movie , if I 'm not on some sort of medication . And this is another good movie for the medicated . There are no major laughs , no complex plot lines , no difficult twists . Herbie Fully Loaded is great for the fully loaded . This was the first time I had seen La Lohan on the screen since she swapped places with Jamie Lee Curtis ( I thought she was excellent in that ) , and I can't say I was terribly impressed this time around . Aside from her constantly changing and distractingly unnatural hair color , she just didn't ring true as the kid next door who had spent a lifetime hanging around road racers . Her ' need for speed ' wasn't portrayed consistently in the film - perhaps it was elsewhere - she looked older than her part , and seemed to always be looking for something ( a party ? designer togs ? new place to spend money ? ) off set . I couldn't see any chemistry with Justin Long ; that romance seemed obligatory at best . The only time Lindsay appeared engaged was when she was interacting with Matt Dillon , who I thought was appropriately over the top as Evil Bad Guy Trip Murphy . It was great to see Herbie again , and I loved the movie intro with material from the old movies . If Disney had popped out with some Car 53 jewelry , I might have worn some just to be loyal . His new feature ( ? ) was a little inconsistent ( does he channel the thoughts of his driver ? Does he now skateboard ? ) but whatever . We all knew how it was going to end , but I do wish he had ended up with someone a little less dopey than Maggie . And my head still hurts from that lesson Maggie and we viewers had hammered home . What would have made the movie worthwhile ? Have the old Herbie in a real story with a real plot - at the very least , Herbie 's as good as Lassie - but clearly that 's asking too much . Why is it that Disney always goes back to the same well as " Herbie Goes Bananas " and " the Computer That Wore Tennis Shoes " when it comes to innovation ? I 'm sure this was a great movie for kids and those with no expectations . For the rest of us .. it 's for when you have the ' flu and just can't take the suspense of Rear Window .  
  Here 's a movie with a good cast and nice looking location work but it just don't have it . Director Richard Brooks must have been a little bit tired at this stage of the game ; How much better his THE PROFESSIONALS was ! The horses and the rest of the action seemed to be in slow motion even during the non-slow motion scenes . This film needed to be sped-up , if anything . That horse lather sure looked awful phony to me and the obvious tire tracks in those desert tracking moments - just lazy . sloppy work . Too bad . The actors did OK , but I 've certainly seen all of them do better . Ben Johnson 's always a joy , though . I first saw this flick almost 30 years ago ; was disappointed then and remained so upon second viewing 30 years later .  
  Friday the 13th step over ! There is officially a worse movie than your hateful series out there . I won this movie in a contest at college , and it was a waste of money even if it was free . Jack Jones stars as a truly awful singer whose trying to find some murderers or something . At least Friday the Thirteenth never bored me . I 'd rather have my fingernails pulled than see this again .  
  don't expect much from this film . In many ways this film resembles a film that Doris Day starred in in 1956 , title , Julie . In this film Doris , who was a flight attendant , stewardess , in those days , landed the air craft after her derange husband , played by Louis Jordan shot the captain . She did a far better job , more convincing , than Kim Ojah , who took control of a 747 and manage to land it without much help from the control tower . I know a little about 747 aircraft , i use to be a flight attendant myself . Like i said , do not expect much from this film , it was done on a cheap budget . The producers were to cheap to use a plane with the name of a airline on it . Oceanic is one name that several movies have used . The only writing on this plane was the name of the company that made the aircraft .  
  from the start of this movie you soon become aware that the name of the film has nothing to do with the movie itself from watching a naked woman being chased by people in very silly masks to servants running round in the worst clothing I 've ever seen and all this in subtitles makes this the kind of movie you should think twice about seeing and as the film slowly moves along you soon realise that the vampire is not a vampire you got to wonder where the title came from some parts of the film made a bit of sense with Pierre and is father but as the film gets to its really silly ending you have got to think why end a film this way and surly they had a better ending if only in there heads this is not a film to watch basically  
  Couldn't believe it ! Clipped sentences ? Good grief ! Know what ? All true ! Real people ever talk like this ? Don't think so . Good girl ! Stout fellow ! Stiffen upper lip ! Only reason given movie 2 instead of 0 Gary Cooper such a dish . Movie as a whole ridiculous unless you like watching endless biplane dogfights . Seemed endless , anyway . Think all Franchot Tone 's dialogue dubbed . When Crawford and Young make a special effort to sound British they come over as Irish . Handy tip - we Brits clip words , not sentences . And somehow we manage to draawl at the same time . But that 's only if we 've been to a really good public ( that 's private to you ) school .  
  The movie is steeped in religion , so it is impossible to separate it from religion in commenting upon it . In my opinion , this movie pretends to explore deep issues , but thrives on stereotypes and prejudices ; with little true insight . What the people in the movie ( and therefore , the writer ) failed to see was grace . They failed to understand that God is the author of beauty and He is the Creator of passion and sexual gratification in the proper context of marriage bonds . To imply that the people of the society in which the story is based believe that nudity is sinful , and both the man & the woman enjoying the act of marriage is dirty , is just an oversimplification . Such stereotypes really don't exist , for even Jewish holy writings speak clearly of the caring husband who will seek his wife 's pleasure before his own . Scripture says that a man ought to love his wife as his own flesh , and that no man ever hated his own flesh , but he nourishes and cherishes it . Even if you want to ignore the New Testament , the writers & characters completely ignore that there are passages such as the Song of Solomon in the Old Testament , and the even the book of Proverbs which says , " Rejoice in the wife of thy youth , let her breasts satisfy you always " ! How can that be read in any way other way than that God knows , and approves of , and smiles on , the marital union and the enjoyment thereof ? Real men don't ignore the value and needs of their wives . Those that do deny a very basic teaching of the Judeo / Christian religion . God NEVER said those things . It 's absurd . Sonia rebelled because of the misapplication of the teachings of the true God of Abraham . It didn't need to be so . How sad . What Sonia desperately needed was TRUTH , not tradition . In knowing , loving and obeying God , we love others more ; before ourselves . That is the faith of the God of Abraham , Isaac , Jacob & Joseph ; once for all delivered to the Saints ; bought & paid for by Jesus Christ , the Righteous . But alright , ignore all this and abandon ancient , holy Scripture and turn to the wisdom of homeless people & ghosts . That 's a good plan . I would never recommend this movie ; partly because the sexual content is unnecessarily graphic , but also because it really doesn't offer any valuable insight . Check out " Yentl " if you want to see a much more useful treatment of Jewish tradition at odds with society .  
  I am so appalled by this documentary . I am deeply embarrassed and ashamed by the way Puertoricans were portrayed . This documentary was not about the culture of Puertoricans . It was about the culture of Nuyoricans . Puertoricans and Nuyoricans are two different cultures . Very different cultures and should not be generalized to the Puerto Rican population . Rosie , before you make a documentary , you need to do the research . You also need to check and make sure your sources are credible . Puerto Ricans are not all loud and they do have class , which is one thing the documentary lacked to show . When I saw Rosie and Jimmie on the View and Rosie on Martha Stewart I was very excited about watching . I even made sure to let my parents know since they love Puerto Rico so much . After the first five minutes I could not believe how the documentary bashed the US and made Puerto Ricans look like a bunch of guinea pigs . You need to go and visit Puerto Rico and you will see that Puerto Rico is not a 3rd world country where more than 50 % of the population is in poverty . Puerto Rico has colleges and well known Universities , roads , cars , shopping centers , malls ( The largest Kmart and JCPenney 's I 've ever seen ) , restaurants , theaters , beaches , hotels ( Ritz , Hilton , etc . ) , casinos , churches , agriculture , Auto Expresso , and restaurants just to name a few . Poverty ? NOT 50 % of the population is . Puerto Rican culture is about family , music , food , celebrating , and trying to move forward not backward . Oh , and new cousins don't just pop up out of no where . No that is not a Puerto Rican thing , that is a ghetto thing . We are not bastards . Parents of Puertorican descent who would like to teach their children about Puerto Rico should invest in a trip with the family so they can see first hand what Puerto Rico is all about . They will see its beauty , people and culture . Please don't show them this documentary because it will only cloud their minds with negativity . Oh , and please don't tell your American friends to watch this documentary because it will only make the Puertorican people look ignorant . Yes , I am born and raised PUERTO RICAN from the island . Just so you know !  
  .. in an otherwise ghastly , misbegotten , would-be Oedipal comedy . I was the lone victim at a 7:20 screening tonight ( 3 days after the movie opened ) , so there is some satisfaction in knowing that moviegoers heeded warnings . The bloom is off Jon Heder 's rose . The emerging double chin isn't his fault ; but rehashing his geeky kid shtick in another bad wig simply isn't working . It would be another crime if this were to be Eli Wallach 's last screen appearance . Diane Keaton will probably survive having taken this paycheck - basically because so few will have seen her in this , the very worst vehicle she 's chosen in the last few weeks . Sitting alone in the theater tonight I came alive ( laughed , even ) whenever Daniels was given the latitude in which to deliver the film 's sole three dimensional character . He really is among our very best actors . In summary , even Jeff Daniels 's work can't redeem this picture .  
  The most positive thing I can say for this dull witted local " comedy " production is that it 's inoffensive . In fact it 's so astonishingly bland that one wonders how many dozens of re-writes by committee it went through to have such a complete removal of personality . It 's not witty , it 's not entertaining , it 's not insightful , and it 's not charming . It 's just a staid , laughless , progression of four losers who must change their ways - and their attitudes towards women - to be allowed to attend their best friend 's wedding . With acting that would be sub par for the local amateur dramatics society , a plot line so tired it 'd make a forty third season of ' Allo ' Allo look fresh , and jokes about as humorous as watching decaying vegetables , Sione 's Wedding nonetheless scored ten ( yes 10 ) nominations in the NZ film awards recently . Fortunately , somebody saw sense and it didn't win any .  
  Was this a comedy or was it a drama ? I begin this review by asking this question because the film that I just witnessed , Hollywood Shuffle , was neither funny or rather dramatic . While it tried so hard to make a point , because of this lack of definition ( comedy or drama ) , the clever themes and pointed remarks were lost . While I am a strong believer that there is too much racial profiling happening in Hollywood , even today , I do not believe that Townsend 's directorial debut did much to stop it . Instead , I feel it only added more fuel to the fire . Townsend 's comic timing in this film was disastrous due to the fact that the elements he was supposed to be making fun of , he was instead promoting and vice versa . The parts that were supposed to be serious were somehow destroyed by the poor lack of funny comedy . Townsend had a decent concept with this film , but sadly the execution is what ultimately hurt this film . If you watch the preview before the film ( which I constantly do ) , you will immediately get the wrong impression of what you are going to see . The preview gives the impression of a very intelligent , comic film that prides itself on the intelligence of the viewers , but the actually film could not be further from the truth . The main problem with Hollywood Shuffle is not story itself ( because it is lacking in elaboration ) ; it is Townsend 's direction . He had a wonderful concept with this film . Exploit the Hollywood that exploits our race . Decent idea , but why couldn't he execute it very well ? The first reason is that his ideas are too random and sporadic . The structure of this film was like watching a heart attack on a monitor at the hospital , we are literally everywhere without any warning or map . It was obvious that Townsend had quite a bit to say , but only a short amount of time to do it in . So , instead of defining his characters , developing his themes , and actually creating a smart film , he just throws it all together and prays that it works . Sadly , it doesn't . Instead of a smart comedy , we have a hodgepodge of so many ideas , comedic skits , and underused actors that this film goes from decent to nearly unwatchable . What hurts Townsend the most are his brief , attempt to be funny , interruptions throughout the film . From battling a villain known as Jerry Curl to parodying Siskel & Ebert , Townsend 's attempt to poke fun while speak a message about the film industry falters . This is because these small intermittent skits actually distract from the central focus of the film and actually destroy internally . While Townsend seems to be trying to make a joke about life in Hollywood , he actually is simply connecting to every stereotype and cliché in the book . What could have been beautiful satire transforms into simply generic humor that never quite stands apart from the rest . So , if you find yourself not laughing at the humor of this story , perhaps there is some comfort in knowing that some of the Wayans brothers are around to help spice up this dull story . WRONG ! The Wayans are in this film , but Townsend demonstrates that he has the ability to even bring the worst out even in this entertaining family . Definitely in their pre-In Living Color moments , we see that comedy was something that all needed to constantly improve upon . Perhaps it was Townsend 's direction , or just maybe this atrocious story , but these typically funny comedians were obviously underused and ignored when it came to critics of this film . I just thought that with the talent pool that Townsend had to pull from that Hollywood Shuffle would have been funny , bright , and a true stab at this obvious Hollywood dilemma . Sadly , it was none of the above . Finally , I would like to say that this was a workable film . There were some moments ( while they were few and way far between ) that had a smile on my face , the final product just didn't settle well with me . Townsend can be funny , but in this film it just felt like he was playing against himself , instead of through his personal experiences and troubles . I realize that he was probably speaking the truth , but it never came through as that . Instead , we are threaded through a weak story , which supports itself with idiotic flash clips that may have worked for a sitcom , but surely didn't work for this film . Even for those that comment that this was his directorial debut and that he was learning from this film , I would have to disagree . If you are starting fresh , either have a tight script or defined themes . Townsend had neither of these , and combined with the inability to control his actors , he just failed in a ball of flames . Overall , this was rather disappointing to watch . It reminded me of a grade school Spelling Bee where it is finally your child 's time to spell . The word is tough , but as the first two to three letters come out , you think that it is going to work perfectly , but then there is that random " P " and silent " R " that forces your excitement to come tumbling down . That is how I felt with Hollywood Shuffle . At first , I saw the potential , I saw the theme and the motive behind the picture , but through fuzzy and inexperienced technique and after the first couple of scenes , I experienced that deep fall feeling . Townsend sank his own ship on this one , and I don't think Hollywood Shuffle will ever re-submerge as a pivotal moment of Hollywood cinema . Grade : * out of *  
  How they got Al Pacino to play in this movie is beyond me . This movie is absolutely terrible . I discovered , after reading some of the other reviews , that a couple of people actually enjoyed this film , which deeply puzzles me , because I do not see how anyone in their right mind could possibly enjoy a movie as awful as Revolution . It 's not just that it 's a bad movie , with a lame plot and overall strangeness that is extremely unpleasant , but it seems as if the filmmakers were either mentally retarded ( which is a very possible explanation as to why this movie sucks like it does , though it probably still sucks even compared to other films made by retards ) or deliberately made every illogical decision to make this movie suck as much as possible . For example , we see Donald Sutherland running around with a huge , fat ugly mole on his face . He does not normally have a mole . The mole does not add to his character . It is extremely ugly and distracting . It 's not like Robert De Niro 's mole ; it 's much worse . Why the hell has he got that mole ? It 's as if the filmmakers just said , " Let 's see , how could we make this movie even worse than it already is ? I know , let 's give Mr . Sutherland a giant , ugly-ass mole right on his face . " Another example of the filmmakers ' stupidity is the character Ned . We see , for the first three-quarters of the movie , young Ned . At one point , " six months later " appears on the screen . We see Ned again , and it is , of course , the same actor playing the boy . Five minutes later , " three weeks later " appears on the screen , and all of a sudden we 've got a different actor playing as the now older Ned . What , do they think we 're idiots ? Good God ! Again , it 's like the filmmakers are saying , " How can we possibly make it any worse ? I don't think we can .. Oh wait ! I just had a terrible idea ! " I know a kid doesn't grow much in half a year , which is fine , but he at least grows more than he does in three weeks . Just don't get another actor to play Ned , or at least get him to play the five minutes when he 's three weeks younger . Furthermore , the kid who plays the " older " Ned does not look any older than " young " Ned . As a matter of fact , he just looks completely different , much skinnier , and no taller or older than the original actor , which is very confusing , as I , like any rational human being , thought at first that it was a new and different character . What , did the first kid die while they were filming the movie ? Because he was in it for the first hour and a half , and then all of a sudden , three weeks later , the guy from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is playing Ned for the last five minutes of the movie . And even if the original actor did die , the filmmakers should have at least gotten an actor who looks like him to play the remainder of his role , and re-shoot the measly five minutes of " six months later " scenes . Better yet , just scrap the movie completely , never finish it and never release , never even tell anybody about it , because by that point they should have realized that their movie sucks and in finishing it they would only waste more money and time and succeed in making one of the worst movies of all time . I 'm not saying that this movie is so bad you shouldn't watch it ; it 's so bad that you SHOULD watch it , just to see how badly it sucks . It 's terrible , terrible .  
  Brilliant actor as he is , Al Pacino completely derails Revolution  his Method acting approach is totally ill-suited to the role of an illiterate trapper caught up in the American War of Independence . Much of the blame should be attributed to director Hugh Hudson ( yes , the man who made Chariots Of Fire just a couple of years earlier  talk about a come-down ! ) . One of the many jobs of a director is to marshal the actors , coaxing believable performances from them , but in this case Hudson has allowed Pacino to run amok without asking for restraint of any kind . It 's not just Al 's career-low performance that hinders the film though : there are numerous other flaws with Revolution , more of which will be said later . Illiterate trapper Tom Dobb ( Al Pacino ) lives in the north-eastern region of America with his son Ned ( Sid Owen / Dexter Fletcher ) . He leads a simple life  living off the land , raising his son , surviving against the elements . The country is lorded over by the English colonialists , but during an eight year period ( 1775-83 ) a revolution takes place which ends with the British being defeated and the independent American nation being born . Dobb gets caught up in the events when his boat and his son are conscripted by the Continental Army  swept away by events they can barely understand , the Dobbs finds themselves fighting for their lives and freedom in one bloody engagement after another . Tom also falls in love with Daisy McConnahay ( Natassja Kinski ) , a beautiful and fiery woman of British aristocratic ancestry . Their forbidden love is played out against the larger historical context of the fighting . Where to start with the film 's flaws ? Most key actors are miscast  Pacino has been criticised enough already , but Kinski fares little better as the renegade aristocrat while Donald Sutherland is hopelessly lost as a ruthless English soldier with a wobbly Yorkshire accent . Robert Dillon 's script is muddled in its attempts to bring massive historical events down to a personal level . At no point does anyone seem to have decided whether this is meant to be an intimate character study with the American Revolution as a backdrop , or an epic war film with a handful of sharply drawn characters used to carry the story along . As a result , the narrative falls into no man 's land , flitting from " grand spectacle " to " small story " indiscriminately and meaninglessly . John Corigliano 's score is quite ghastly , and is poured over the proceedings with neither thought nor subtlety . Hugh Hudson 's direction is clumsy throughout , both in his mismanagement of Pacino and the other key actors , and in the decision to use irritatingly shaky camera work during the action sequences . The idea of the hand-held camera is to create immediacy  that feeling of " being there " in the confusion of battle and musket fire . Like so many other things in the film , it doesn't work . The one department where the film regains a modicum of respectability is the period detail , with costumes , sets and weaponry that look consistently accurate . But if it 's period detail you 're interested in a trip to the museum would be a better way to spend your time , because as a rousing cinematic experience Revolution doesn't even begin to make the grade . Nothing more than a £18,000,000 mega-bomb that the ailing British film industry could ill afford in the mid-1980s .  
  On his birthday a small boys tells his mother he is not her son , and that he wants to go home to his real mother . In some ways Comedy De L'Innocence feels like it comes from a different time of movie-making , perhaps the 60 's or 70 's . Certainly it reminded me of Losey 's Secret Ceremony ( 1968 ) , and Richard Loncraine 's Full Circle ( 1977 ) , both of which deal with loss , grief and relationships between parents and ' lost ' children ( curiously both films star Mia Farrow ) . All three films are populated with unsympathetic characters who behave in strange and unexplained ways . All three films have a chilly feel , both emotionally and literally . All three films focus on mother-child relationships , and ultimately all three films pose the question - ' what is real , what is imagined ? ' Beautiful but flawed , it offers no easy answers and leaves much hanging , unexplained and strange .  
  The story and the show were good , but it was really depressing and I hate depressing movies . Ri'Chard is great . He really put on a top notch performance , and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous . Seriously , I thought she was Carmen Electra until I saw the IMDb profile . I can't say anything bad about Peter Galleghar . He 's one of my favorite actors . I love Anne Rice . I 'm currently reading the Vampire Chronicles , but I 'm glad I saw the movie before reading the book . This is a little too " real " for me . I prefer Lestat and Louis 's witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves . Eartha Kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did The movie was ruined for me ; I could barely stand to watch the rest of the show . ( sorry for the ambiguity , but I don't want to give anything away ) Sorry , but it 's just not my type of show .  
  As many others have stated , this is a terrible movie , from every aspect of movie making . How they ever got some known name actors to take on this project is amazing . Many people have complained that it was shot on ' cheap ' video cameras . Yes , it was shot on video , but not ' cheap ' video . What made it bad was the lighting , white balancing , shooting technique and editing . There were so many different shooting and editing techniques used that it was a production mess . Harsh , inconsistent lighting , over use of hand held shooting ( ala Woody Allen ) , choppy editing ( another Allen technique ) , but poorly done , without real purpose . The lack of white balance in the restaurant kitchen scenes is embarrassing ; very amateurish . The simulated sex scenes had no acting value at any level . How this video ever made it to print is beyond me . It is worth watching if only to be amazed at how bad it is .  
  The story and the show were good , but it was really depressing and I hate depressing movies . Ri'Chard is great . He really put on a top notch performance , and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous . Seriously , I thought she was Carmen Electra until I saw the IMDb profile . I can't say anything bad about Peter Galleghar . He 's one of my favorite actors . I love Anne Rice . I 'm currently reading the Vampire Chronicles , but I 'm glad I saw the movie before reading the book . This is a little too " real " for me . I prefer Lestat and Louis 's witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves . Eartha Kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did The movie was ruined for me ; I could barely stand to watch the rest of the show . ( sorry for the ambiguity , but I don't want to give anything away ) Sorry , but it 's just not my type of show .  
  VILLA RIDES ( 1968 ) turns out to be something of a big disappointment ! And even though Sam Peckinpah had a hand in the screenplay , along with Robert Towne , it still emerges as a leadenly written movie dryly directed by the undistinguished Buzz Kulik . Firstly , top billed Yul Brynner as Pancho Villa is wrong for the part ! He 's not charismatic enough to play the great Mexican revolutionary ! His one note performance lacks the fire and gusto Anthony Quinn or Gilbert Roland could have brought to the role . Brynner simply looks like a Russian aristocrat dressed up like a Mexican bandit who is in the middle of the Mexican revolution instead of the Russian one . Also , second billed Robert Mitchum is totally wasted in the picture ! His part as a biplane flying ace lobbing home-made bombs from the air in the cause of the revolution is a poorly written meager role that could have been played by any minor star . Mitch hasn't a decent line in the entire movie and brings to one 's mind his other Mexican revolution picture the far superior " Bandido " ( 1956 ) which unfortunately nobody seems to have any interest in releasing on DVD . Besides lacking any kind of style " Villa Rides " also suffers badly without the presence of a female star ! There is starlet Grazia Buccella as a young Mexican girl who gives Mitchum the glad eye but her casting is merely perfunctory . Someone like Claudia Cardinale or Jean Peters could have perhaps added a couple of badly needed notches to the faltering story line . There are a couple of good action scenes in the movie but a couple of good action scenes do not a movie make and the less than perfect Panavision picture quality plus the over repetitive Maurice Jarre theme tune doesn't help matters . As is Paramount 's wont there are no extras - not even a trailer ! Yup , a disappointing movie and DVD presentation that could have been and should have been a whole lot better .  
  It was almost worth sitting through this entire god-awful " film " just to know that I can never experience anything as bad as this again . Acting - 0 , script - 0 , fight scenes - 0 , male lead - 0 ( cheddar bob from eight mile as a suave war hero who gets the girl ) , Nadia Bjorlin - 10 ( She is gorgeous and not a terrible actress ) . This is the criteria I used to average it out to a two . I lost count but I believe ever movie cliché , ever , is in this movie . When the driver that supposedly killed her father miraculously shows up at the end to race against her , from out of nowhere it cemented the previous statement . Plus he just shows up for no reason . He was never even mentioned before . I don't know what else to say here . Just watch it when it comes out on TV in a couple years . At least that way some of it will be edited out for commercials .  
  I thought that I was never going to find a horror movie as bad as " The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre " , but this film compete with it . I´m not a person that get asleep when watching a movie , but I did it 15 minutes after the Trance started . I woke up , and started to watching it agian . Why did I deserve that ? All the movie was a torture , I have to use fast forward to watch it complete . I can´t stand why one of my favourites actors of all time ( MR . WALKEN ) could done this thing . I have to think that he made the director a favor , or he was really in the need of money , because film after film he is doing , he is ruining himself ; and so fast .. What about the movie ? it´s not scary , stupid plot , characters are awful ( but I really liked the one played by Jared Harris ) , effects are very poor , lack of deaths & blood , etc ; in three words , it has anything . And I mean it . Can´t stand how a director can make a film like this . Anyway , When I got more disappointed was when I saw in the video cover , that the film was presented by " Stephen King " , I think he could never present this crap , no ? ( I rented it in Argentina ) . I not recommend it in a million years . I rate this movie with a 2 out of 10 . ( As I say in my " Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre " review , there will be always a worse movies , thats why it don´t deserves a 1 out of 10 )  
  Being that I loved the original " Caligula " even with all its flaws , I have to say this remake trailer was abysmal . Listening to Jovovich say in that lazy American accent " Mmm cuhligyooluh .. " makes me feel sick . The set doesn't look Roman at all .. it looks like some rich actor 's Hollywood mansion backyard , and the Roman costumes look like cheap crap you buy at a suburban costume shop . That " charming " Adriana Asti looks like a fifty year old Hispanic woman totally terrified out of her mind , as if not knowing it 's a movie trailer . The acting has got to be some of the worst I 've ever seen , with most of the lines I hear being random actors screaming " CALIGULAA ! " as loudly and obnoxiously annoyingly as they can . The random sex scenes also filled a good 40 or 50 % of the trailer , and the scenes with notable actors / actresses like Gerard Butler ( who graces the screen in shadows for all of three and a half seconds ) not doing anything but looking uncomfortable or going all-out over the top with their minimal lines , just dragging it down with the ridiculousness of their delivery . Courtney Love 's part consists of her looking like her usual dumpy crack-whore self leaning against a door mumbling about the moon or something . You can't tell because she 's either drunk or high or just mumbling idiotically . Karen Black is just annoying .. randomly laughing , and screaming in such a way that irritates you . Helen Mirren .. she was in the original , and her return to " Caligula " consists of .. " CAALIGULAA ! " I particularly " love " ( and by love , I mean hate ) Ennia 's line , " Caligola .. j00 no maki me * something incoherent * .. * something that sounds like j00nalo * " It 's also insanely arrogant to say Caligula 's four year reign was greater than Jesus 's birth and death . Honestly , this has got to be the worst , most exploitative , self-indulgently arrogant piece of crap labeled as " art " I 've ever seen . Even if Gore Vidal hated the original Caligula , he shouldn't have shown up or given his name over for this crap-pile , no matter how much they paid him ( unless it was a billion trillion yen ) . Worst trailer ever .  
  I was a huge fan of the original cartoon series , and was looking forward to finally seeing Gadget on the big screen - but I never in my wildest dreams expected something so extremely extremely terrible . The pace was WAY too fast , there was no plot , and ' wowser ! ' - what the hell is that ? It was ' WOWSERS ! ' .  
  This could have been the gay counterpart to Gone With The Wind given its epic lenght , but instead it satisfied itself by being a huge chain of empty episodes in which absolutely nothing occurs . The characters are uni-dimensional and have no other development in the story ( there 's actually no story either ) than looking for each other and kissing . It 's a shame that an interesting aesthetic proposition like having almost no dialog is completely wasted in a film than makes no effort in examining the psychology of its characters with some dignity , and achieving true emotional resonance . On top of that , it pretends to be an " art " film by using the worst naive clichés of the cinematic snobbery . But anyway , if someone can identify with its heavy banality , I guess that 's fine .  
  From the opening dialog and scenes , I knew I knew I was in for a train wreck . Didn't want to look , but couldn't turn away . If it weren't for the meer eye candy of this film , I would have given one star . The fact that the interaction between characters and relationship behavior were so far fetched , added by poor direction and horrible story make this movie nothing more than a low-budget disaster . Money is definitely not a necessity to make a good film . But this movie fails so horribly there was no chance to rebound . If you were stuck out in the woods , your childhood best friend dying from an unknown disease , other friends dying around you , stranded in a strange place , what would you do ? A . ) Run away from everyone and try your luck on your own . B . ) Have sex with your friends girlfriend . C . ) Take a hot bath to relax your sorrows to include shaving your legs . D . ) Bash in the head your childhood best friend and life-long crush with a shovel . E . ) All of the above . According to Eli Roth , none of these answers are that far fetched . In fact , all are plausible and well represented in Cabin Fever . The total lack of reality and illogical attempt at explaining what people would do in traumatic situations throws this film in the bonehead bin at your local rental store . Stay away . Stay far away .  
  I 've rented and watched this movie for the 1st time on DVD without reading any reviews about it . So , after 15 minutes of watching I 've noticed that something is wrong with this movie ; it 's TERRIBLE ! I mean , in the trailers it looked scary and serious ! I think that Eli Roth ( Mr . Director ) thought that if all the characters in this film were stupid , the movie would be funny .. ( So stupid , it 's funny .. ? WRONG ! ) He should watch and learn from better horror-comedies such as : " Fright Night " , " The Lost Boys " and " The Return Of the Living Dead " ! Those are funny ! " Cabin Fever " is THE reason why I registered to ww . IMDb . com so I can release my thoughts of discontent about it . I 've decided to watch the movie a second time > AARGH ! < and make notes for my partial " review " to show how foolish the movie is . " Resident Evil " ( horror ) or " Dude , Where 's My Car ? " ( comedy ) I can watch over and over again and still enjoy ! But this .. ! How bad can a script and a director be ? This bad . Here are the awful scenes in chronological order : In the early scenes we see Henry , who doesn't realize his dog lying on the ground with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and dead-glazed stare is dead ! The movie doesn't explain anything about the blonde long-haired kid who like to bite people . And my answer to Marcy 's unanswered question ( " What 's wrong with the woods ? " ) is " nothing " . The script has that bearded guy warn them about the woods just for " suspense " . Then the " smartest " of the 5-pack , Bert , almost gives us an example of how to start a forest fire . He meets now-infected Henry who begs for help and from here on the movie wants to break the record in using the " F-word " . Bert starts to freak out because Henry looks awfully ill . Bert : " Don't make me shoot you ! " ( he forgets to add : " .. with my BB gun ! " ) Bert heads back to the cabin but how about that ? He meets Marcy and Jeff who were having sex , but now suddenly decide to go out for a walk ! Marcy wisely takes out the unguarded campfire Bert had started earlier ( A moment of clarity for a change ? ) Bert doesn't mention a word about Henry because the fool thinks he has killed him with his BB gun . Later , as the Five Estupidos sit around their campfire , another weirdo shows up with his dog . ( Maybe that 's what the warning about the woods is all about ? It 's filled with weirdos .. and their dogs ! ? ) They let him sit with them only because he has a huge bag filled with cannabis . ( Their brains are completely intoxicated ! No wonder why they are all so DUMB ! ) This is the last time we 'll see this forgettable character .. alive ! Henry shows up at their cabin , ( NOTE : He was lying all the time a few yards from their cabin ! ) looking worse , almost like a zombie , covered in goo ! He says he needs a doctor . But the Young Einsteins refuse to help the poor sucker . He gets into their unlocked truck which of course also has its key in the ignition . Henry almost seems smart enough to drive the Hell away from there but instead starts puking blood all over the dashboard , seats and windows . The Fantastic Five come out running , armed with : a BB Gun , a knife , a baseball bat ( * huh ? Ever tried playing baseball in the middle of the woods ? ) , a poker , and a ( insecticide ? ) spray-can , ready to combat the single , unarmed and terribly sick man . ( clever script ! ) Bert manages to kill the car with one single shot of his BB Gun , which is only possible in the mind of director Eli Roth . " What else am I supposed to do ? " Bert yells in his defense . Jeff and Paul try to knock Henry down with their bat and poker but miss and crash the truck 's windows instead . Henry walks up to the dumb girls who say : " He 's coming towards us ! " ( Thanks for the info , dumb broads , I can see that ! But I don't think he wants to do you any harm ! ) Marcy sprays in his eyes , making Henry yelp ! And our " hero " Paul touches Henry 's arm with a burning log from the campfire , which they recklessly left burning while they were INSIDE the cabin ! ( Where has all that wisdom gone ? I guess the cannabis had started to take its toll ! : - ) Henry turns into The Human Torch and runs away , screaming . The following day , Bert and Jeff head out for a mechanic . And Marcy decides to " go for help " all by herself , in the woods , as Paul stays behind with Karen .. Doesn't that sound idiotic ? Marcy could have stayed with Karen and Paul because Jeff and Bert were already " going for help " ! I skip my comments now to how we suddenly see Marcy in a CANOE rowing over a huge and winding river ! How did she get a canoe ? Does she even know where she 's going ! ? Anyway , she goes to the riverbank and finds a very big and seemingly abandoned cabin and , like in most horror movies , walks inside the cabin saying : " Hello ? Is anyone there ? " Bert suddenly pops up from behind a furniture and scares her ( and me at first ) . And along comes Jeff , as well . How did THEY get here ! ? Did they swim across the river ? Do you see how brainless the script is ! ? Deputy Winston meets Paul at the cabin . He somehow doesn't notice the blood on their truck . This happens around 35 minutes of viewing and I have decided to stop torturing myself anymore and popped the DVD out . ( Before I take my own eyes out ! .. Now , THAT 's funny ! ) If you liked this movie , do yourself a favor and watch " Fright Night " , " The Lost Boys " , or " The Return of The Living Dead " . Then you 'll see they are MORE entertaining than this .. thing . Even the " Toxic Avenger part 2 " , which is also a lousy film , is way MORE funnier than " Cabin Fever " .  
  No spoilers here but I have been a fan since Waking the Dead started but the last series , of which only 3 have been on so far is awful . The stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series . I found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous . As a BBC licence payer , after the show I rang BBC complaints to pass on my disappointment . I 'm amazed that actors of the calibre of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone didn't object to the story lines . These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons , surly they can see it 's lost all direction . It 's a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of Father Christmas ! Paul Bentley , West Yorkshire , England .  
  I am truly beginning to believe that Seagal is on a mission to see how crappy his films could become . This particular movie was a complete and utter waste of time to see . My first complaint was the cover of the DVD where they have doctored his pic and made him look slimmer and younger when in the film he looks like crap . He has his big pot belly and double chin going for him and the most miserable and bored look on his face . The whole plot was ridiculous to begin with and drawn out way too long . The whole film was leading up to the finale where Seagal and his team had to take on a bunch of people under the influence of a top secret military chemical adrenaline enhancer . There was way too much useless dialogue and not to mention the ridiculous and constant dubbing of Seagals voice even in the middle of a statement . The dubbed voice sounded like a man with a frog in his throat and was quite comical . The fight scenes in the film were horrible . Half the time when Seagal fought you could not even see what was going on . There would be tight shots of him flapping his arms at the camera and then the person flying through a wall or something . It was reminiscent of the old Kung Fu series on television . They used way too much slow motion for the fight scenes . I believe this is Seagals worst film to date and I am glad I did not purchase this film or I would have been very upset since I am a huge fan of Seagal the Aikidoist . The action star is quickly fading away and seems to be getting worse with every performance .  
  I had the misfortune of wasting 10 quid buying SS new movie on DVD : Attack Force . Now i usually can suspend my belief watching films like this . A pinch of salt and some beers on a dark evening on the sofa watching a noisy late evening shoot em up is perfect for a single alpha male like me . I bought this film thinking I 'd see cool martial arts and shoot em up . Did i hell . Segal is old and bloated , the plot was ludicrous even by SS standards and to cap it all off Segal 's acting ( such as it was to start with ) is exceptionally dire . So dire in fact that half of his voice was dubbed over by a man who sounded NOTHING LIKE HIM . Either SS cant act no more ( a moot point ) of the crew were so dreadful at their jobs they couldn't record the sound properly . The voice would flick back and forth between Mr Whisper Segal and the man who does voice overs for Honda adverts ! Plot wise isn't the issue because most action films work along the same premise as this one , nothing new there . The usual mix of characters who will die horribly as cannon fodder and stereotyped bad guys waiting to get blown away . Avoid this film like you would avoid walking in front of a speeding train or a dose of H5N1 avian flu . Utter garbage . 1/10 This has been a public health warning .  
  I had a feeling that after " Submerged " , this one wouldn't be any better .. I was right . He must be looking for champagne money , and not care about the final product .. his voice gets repeatedly dubbed over by a stranger that sounds nothing like him ; the editing is - well - just a grade above amateurish . It 's nothing more than a B or C-grade movie with just enough money to hire a couple talented cameramen and an " OK " sound designer . Like the previous poster said , the problems seem to appear in post-production ( .. voice dubbing , etc . ) Too bad , cause the plot 's actually OK for a SG flick . I 'll never rent another SG flick , unless he emails me asking for forgiveness . Too bad - I miss Kelly LeBrock .. - jimbo  
  Steven Seagal .. how could you be a part of such an awful film ? I rented this movie because your movies usually have been pretty clean . I have lost a lot of respect for you being in an awful movie such as this one . Very , very poor taste ! I am embarrassed that I even rented this movie . Steven , if you keep acting in movies like this one , I believe that your career is over . My husband and I have enjoyed watching many of your movies because you always can " get the bad guy " with a few hand maneuvers and make it clean .. and also the language is pretty clean in your movies .. but this one is something else . I will think twice before I rent another movie of yours .  
  Steven buddy , you remember when you said this : " Try to find the path of least resistance and use it without harming others . Live with integrity and morality , not only with people but with all beings . " you have not been doing that , you have mortally wounded your fans and their morality with these " films " I wouldn't even bother if I didn't know you are so much better than this , I 've seen the videos of you teaching , you are so much better than this why why brother why .. steamroller productions has been steamrolled I promise bro i am not afraid of you I will tell you the truth to your face so we can fix it . well I like some others fell asleep 90 % in , but to be fair i was tired and had a large meal just an hour before hand Sensai , what are you doing . 12 million ? really ? do you have any idea what we could have done with $ 12,000,000 It could have been in the theaters and a blockbuster hit , if you wanted we could have donated money from the huge profit to a homeless shelter or something . These post production people are ripping you off man the choreography was non existent , we can do better man , the eye blinking thing was from the men in black movie , i half expected will smith to appear or tommy lee Jones to tell your they were gills not eyelids . Seagal you are an Aikido master , why are you doing this to yourself , to us ? when you came on the scene , you had such a fresh direct style , and it was obvious you are a teacher cause the way your moves were so clear and crisp , watching your first three movies i felt like you were teaching me something , now i feel like you are just being ripped off or something i feel like I need to save you buddy , this time you are the one who was killed and I 'm gonna go and get revenge for you by helping you make the best movie ever . bro i know who you really are , i know the truth about the Nico movie . let 's talk . contact me man i got some fresh ideas I am a nit picker , I swear you will not be disappointed with my attention to detail and we 'll do it for the fans man , your fans deserve better , we 're hanging on , but the strand is about to snap . I swear I will not let your movie out the door with a single mistake in it I 'm still trying to figure out if that was the worst dubbing ever , or you have laryngitis , but i promise you i can do a better impression of your voice than the lame * who didn't even try . I sure hope you kicked him in the nuts as his payment . i can come up with a story and a plot that can be matched to your avenging the death of your student / daughter / wife / dog / house plant niche and I promise you we will bring you back , I promise , also I want to go in the direction , that makes people think , if you let me in i promise we will make a movie that people will walk away and have to have a discussion about it , a serious thought provoking , perception altering experience . Steven Seagal This is my official in writing permission for IMDb to release my contact info to you for the purpose of resurrecting one of the best martial arts heroes I have ever seen also , for the record hes not Italian , hes Irish and Jew so you call it bad acting i call it terrific acting , because you have believed for 20 years that Seagal is Italian : ) kinda changes your perception doesn't it .  
  There are some elements that save this movie from being a total catastrophe , but are overshadowed with bad acting , plot holes , deus ex machina thrown ins , stupid dialogs , weak script , and predictable clichés .. What we have here is a horror movie with a storyline that goes nowhere for most of the time . A group of unlikely heroes including a black guy that gets it first ( yeah , that cliché seems to be still very much alive even in Finland ) , seem to have trouble trying to exit a mysteriously empty hospital . There are shrieking ghosts ( very imaginative ) , zombies ( at one point I thought at least they didn't use zombies , but they came ) , and Finnish glam-rock band with demonic make-up on , getting in their way . There is also some time-shift doodle present , but it adds up nothing to the storyline . Autistic girl and a hobo seem to have some deeper understanding of a situation , but they never spell it out to the viewer , or their confused friends . Their lines consist only of profound life lesson thoughts like : " What happens will happen .. " or " Light can't live in the darkness .. " or the ominous " I need a red crayon .. red crayon . " So all this characters ( including worried father and sweet doctor in distress types ) end up doing is running around them dark floors , and from or mistakenly to the demons . Occasionally a ghost or a group of zombies show up , and if it seems a demon keyboardist can't spot a group of six people coming towards it , waving a flashlight and conversing , it was just pretending . And apparently this demon can break through walls without much hassle , but opening elevator door is beyond its capabilities . In the end we even get a " it was all a dream " sequence twist . Or maybe it wasn't . Oh , boy I wish this movie was , and that kind that makes time seem to move faster so it all plays out in just 10 minutes or so ..  
  Lordi was a major hype and revelation in 2007 because they won the Eurovision Song Contest with a ( not-so-heavy ) metal song called " Hard Rock Hallelujah " and appeared on stage dressed like hideous monsters . But , let 's face it , their victory most likely had very little to do with their great musical talents . The Eurovision contest gradually turned into one big political circus over the years and Lordi probably just won because their song finally brought a little change and  even more importantly - because their whole act sort of ingeniously spoofed the whole annual event . The absolute last thing Lordi 's first ( and hopefully last ) horror film brings is change and ingenuity . " Dark Floors " , based on an idea of the lead singer and starring the rest of the band in supportive roles , is a truly unimaginative and hopeless accumulation of clichés . The immense budget ( " Dark Floors " supposedly is the most expensive Finnish film ever ) definitely assures greatly macabre set pieces and impressive make-up art , but what 's the point where there 's no story that is worth telling ? The film takes is set in a busy hospital where a bunch of people , among them a father and his young daughter with an unidentifiable illness , become trapped in the elevator during a power breakdown . When the doors open again , the floors are empty and it looks as if the hospital lies abandoned since many years already . Trying to reach the exit , the group stumbles upon several morbid and inexplicable obstacles , like eyeless corpses , screaming ghosts and Heavy Metal monsters emerging from the floors . The only three points I 'm handing out to " Dark Floors " are exclusively intended for the scenery and the adequate tension building during the first half of the film . For as long as the sinister events don't require an explanation , the atmosphere is quite creepy , but as soon as you realize the explanation will a ) be very stupid or b ) never come , the wholesome just collapses like an unstable house of cards . Lordi 's costumes never really were scary to begin with ( except maybe to traditional Eurovision fans ) and , in combination with a story more reminiscent to Asian ghost-horror , they just look downright pathetic and misfit . With all the national myths and truly unique exterior filming locations , I personally always presumed Finland  The Land of a Thousand Lakes  would be the ideal breeding ground for potentially horrific horror tales , but I guess that 's another disillusion on my account .  
  Who me ? No , I 'm not kidding . That 's what it really says on the video case . Plot ; short version : Pretty woman stands around smiling . This , for some reason , makes all men kill each other . " Find Ariel .. Where 's Ariel .. Can't Find Ariel .. " She 's right behind you , you idiot .. Most of what can be said about this horrendous little Space Opera has already been said , looks like . A bunch of corny actors playing mostly convicts come in after the first selection of actors is knocked off very quickly . Then they get knocked off in the same way . Every scene is broadcast nearly fifteen minutes in advance . Perhaps it was a drawing of straws to see which actors had the most screen time and bigger pay check . The alien virus / hologram / VR witch / glitch seems physically powerless and doesn't do a thing . Why can't she just stay in the computer instead of doing her " teleporting vampire " routine ? ( Actually , it would 've been more interesting if she had been a vampire , or doing more than just standing around looking at people , which is all she ever does . This is enough to make all the men kill each other . Go figure .. ) This isn't really a space flick . There are far more shots of the old western trail , 1950 's Easy Rider trail , Film noir 's night club scene , even a jog on the beach in fantasy-land , none of which has any real depth or even makes any sense . The night club scene is in black and white , of course . Worked with " The Wizard of Oz " . Doesn't work so well , here . This is probably a good thing , as those few shots they DO show of space are depressingly silly . You will probably cry during those moments , especially upon seeing that swirling " space ship " , which looks about three inches long . Nothing is felt for any of the characters , not because they are convicts or have no personality , but because they are in serious need of acting lessons , except for Billy Dee Williams who really does look depressed and at a loss , probably by being in this work .. This is one of those movies that , when viewed with friends , is going to cause some extremely " loud " silences , especially when the nerd throws out his attempt at comic one-liners ( including the line about French-kissing a meteor .. ? Did I hear that right ? Perhaps not .. ) The original virtual reality girls get " killed " , which means nothing , as they are not even real to begin with . Well , the other " characters " aren't , either , but that 's beside the point . Haha . What 's kind of funny is that the scene that graces the video case is some sort of skull-horror-alien looking thing ( green filter added on top of that , to give it more of a .. uh .. green look ) , which is actually the android after he gets killed and ultimately has nothing to do with anything else afoot . Another odd deal I noticed . Whenever there is an explosion ( at least on my cheap DVD copy ) , everything becomes highly pixelated . I don't mean a LITTLE pixelated , I mean HUGE blocks about 1/16th the size of the screen . Wow .  
  This movie is simply not worth the time or money spent . Full of clichés and a plot that makes absolutely no sense ! I cant believe that so many people have given this awful movie a 10 . My guess is they are stooges of the movie maker . If I could give this movie a zero , I would . Too bad IMDb doesn't allow that . The only reason I watched it because I went with a friend who really wanted to see it . Whats sad is that I never had great expectations from this movie to begin with and yet I felt short changed . Take my word , don't waste your $ 8 on this piece of trash . The only entertainment I got out of the movie was making fun of the directors name . In all , highly NOT RECOMMENDED !  
  I watched this film version of R.D. Blackmore 's classic novel as a substitute until the 2001 A & E version was released on video . And what a poor substitution it proved to be ! This version does not have the authentic , I feel like I'm there aspect of the A & E movie . The actors are , for the most part , wooden ( with Sean Bean the exception ) and the " romance " seems forced and contrived . In fact , there is no kissing until the end of the movie ! The triangle between John Ridd , Lorna Doone ( or Lady Lorna Dugal , whichever you prefer ) and the evil Carver Doone isn't mentioned or expanded upon . We don't get much insight into Carver here , or as to why he has some ( if any ) romantic feelings for Lorna . This movie cuts out many of the key and interesting characters of the novel , such as Counsellor Doone , and John 's sharp-tongued youngest sister Lizzie which were crucial to the plot . The screenplay itself is lacking in conviction . The political intrigue also doesn't figure in the script . The way Lorna came into being with the Doones isn't true to the original story . Now , don't get me wrong , Clive Owen is a handsome and talented actor ( watch Gosford Park and King Arthur for confirmation ) but he comes across as bland and stoic throughout , and long hair ( it may have been a bad wig ) just doesn't suit him ! Polly Walker is a lovely and accomplished actress ( see Enchanted April and Patriot Games , in which she also costarred with Sean Bean ) , but she appears colorless and lackluster . She has a cold sore on her lip that make-up can't hide , and the costumes don't seem authentic . The late Robert Stephens does a respectable turn as Sir Ensor Doone , although he only refers to Lorna as his favorite rather than his granddaughter , which she was reputed to be in the book . Also , it seems to me that Owen and Walker are too old for their roles ( maybe it 's the make-up ) and the scenery is brown , cold , gray and barren , without so much of a hint of a sunny sky . I understand that it is set in Southwest England , but it is green there and they do get their sunshine ! The portrayal of Tom Faggus ' character and his " death " , which doesn't happen in the novel , depresses the film even more . The one positive note is Sean Bean 's performance as Carver . Although it doesn't even come close to matching Aidan Gillen 's portrayal in the A & E movie , Bean does make one mean villain . In short , watch this only if you 've got a few hours to kill , but don't expect anything exciting or for it to be true to the novel . See any other version ( but I highly recommend A & E 's film ) over this tired adaptation .  
  Though I 'd heard that " Cama de Gato " was the worst Brazilian movie of the decade , I watched it giving it a chance ; after all , first-time director / producer / writer Alexandre Stockler managed to make his debut feature ( shot in video ) for just US $ 4,000 and - though it looks even cheaper - I can't begin to imagine all he went through to finally get it exhibited in theaters with no big sponsors or production companies behind it ( then as I watched it I realized why ) . But whatever chances you 're ready to give to " Cama de Gato " , they shrink to zero within 10 minutes : it 's an unbelievably preposterous , verbose , ideologically fanatical and technically catastrophic attempt to portray Brazilian upper-middle class youth as a bunch of spoiled neo-Nazis hooked on bad sex , drugs and violence ( and they 're made to look like closeted gays too ) , made with no visible trace of talent , imagination , expertise or notion of structure . Visually and aurally , it recalls the worst amateur stuff you can find on YouTube - only here it lasts NINETY TWO ( count'em ) minutes of unrelenting hysteria and clumsiness , and it 's not even funny-bad . We 've all seen the story before : bored young guys want to have fun , go partying , take drugs and everything goes wrong - there 's gang-rape , spanking , murder , the accidental death ( falling down the staircase ! ) of the mother of one of the boys , culminating with the boys deciding to burn the corpses of the girl and the mother in a garbage landfill . Moral and literal garbage , get it ? The film is heavily influenced by Larry Clark ( especially " Kids " and " Bully " ) , but Clark 's films - though also moralist and sexploitative - are high-class masterworks compared to this crap . I don't think there was ever such monomaniacal drive in a filmmaker to stick his ideas down the audience 's throat : Stockler grabs us by the collar and tries to force his non-stop moralist rant into our brains by repetition and exhaustion - you DO get numb-minded with so much babbling , yelling , inept direction , shaky camera and terrible acting going on . Stockler doesn't care a bit about technique ( the quality of the images , framing , sound recording , soundtrack songs , dialog , sets , editing , etc is uniformly appalling ) , but he 's a narcissistic control-freak : he anticipates the criticisms he 's bound to get by adding subtitles with smartie / cutie comments , and by making the protagonists comment at one point how far-fetched and phony it all is ( I could relate to THAT ) . Despite his megalomaniac ambitions , Stockler seems incapable of giving us a minimum of visual or narrative structure - he can't even decide if he wants gritty realism ( hand-held video camera etc ) or stylization ( repetition of scenes , use of alternate takes , etc ) . Damn , he can't even decide WHERE to put his camera ( there 's use of subjective camera for the THREE leads ) ! The dialog features some of the most stupefyingly banal verbosity ever ; the plot exists simply to justify the director 's profound hatred for his characters and what they stand for . All you see is a filmmaker being hateful , preachy , condemning , moralizing without the benefit of a minimum of talent ( or technique ) to go with it . It 's very disappointing to find Caio Blat in this mess . Certainly one of the most promising young film actors in Brazil , with his sleepy-eyed puppy dog looks and emotional edge that often recall Sal Mineo 's , Blat can be highly effective under good direction ( as in " Carandiru " , " Lavoura Arcaica " , " Proibido Proibir " ) . Here , he 's told to go over the top and he has to play with some of the most embarrassingly under-equipped " actors " in recent memory . He also enters the risky realm of graphic sexploitation scenes ( so goddawful they look rather like web-cam porn ) . The film opens and ends with real interviews with " typical " ( ? ) middle-class youth - Stockler wants us to take those interviews as " proof " of what he 's trying to preach in fiction . But he blatantly despises and makes fun of his interviewees , selecting a highlight of abject , racist , sexist , stupid statements ( which only shows assholes exist everywhere ) . Stockler wants to prove that Brazilian middle-class youths are ALL present or future fascists BECAUSE they 're middle-class and enjoy recreational drugs ( is he saying all neo-fascists are on drugs ? Or that drugs potentialize fascist behavior ? I couldn't tell ) . With its dogmatic self-righteousness , headache-inducing technique and mind-bending boredom , " Cama de Gato " is bad for a 1,000 reasons but , above all , it 's harmful in a very insidious manner : it gives detractors of Brazilian cinema a powerful case of argument . " Cama de Gato " is best unwatched , unmentioned , buried and forgotten .  
  There are so many stupid moments in ' Tower of Death ' / ' Game of Death 2 ' that you really wonder if it 's a spoof . At times , it felt like I was watching a sequel to Kung Pow rather than a Bruce Lee film . To be honest , this film has bugger all to do with ' Game of Death ' . If anything , it 's more a sequel / remake of ' Enter the Dragon ' , incorporating many elements of that film - particularly the actual footage . Bruce Lee 's character Billy Lo ( apparently ) investigates the sudden death of his friend and encounters a piece of film that was left with the man 's daughter . When the body is stolen during the funeral ( ! ) , Billy is also killed and it 's up to his wayward brother to avenge both men 's deaths . Tong Long stars as brother Bobby Lo and doesn't really have the sort of charisma to carry the film . His fighting abilities are very good however . Bruce Lee obviously turns up thanks to ( no longer ) deleted footage simply to cash-in on the legacy . Saying that , on the whole , the footage is actually edited-in better than in ' Game of Death ' but it doesn't stop the film from being a mess . OK , so the fights are actually very entertaining ( dare I say mind-blowing ) and make the film at least watchable . But there are so many daft elements to this film that it really tests your patience . First off , there 's the supposed villain who lives on his palatial estate .. or is that mental institution ? Seriously , the nutter eats raw venison , drinks deer 's blood , carries a monkey on his shoulder and owns some peacocks and lions ( ? ! ) . This attempt to make him look tough and intelligent just makes you feel sorry for him - you half expect someone to escort him back to his room . In fact , this middle section is awful and when the scene involving a naked hooker and a lion suit arrived I turned it off . However , I did finish the film and was kind of glad I did because the fight scene towards the end ( much like ' GOD ' ) was the whole reason for watching . While the story is an embarrassment , the action is very good and contains excellent choreography . But even the finale disappoints if the premise was anything to go by . What we were told was that the ' Tower of Death ' was a pagoda that was upside down and underground . This sounded great , like a twist on Bruce Lee 's original idea with different styles of fighting on each level . Could this be the ' Game of Death ' that was originally planned ? No ! The film should have been named " Generator Room of Death " because thats as far as the tower goes . Of yes , there were indeed one or two ' different ' styles .. there were foil clad grunts , leopard-skinned henchman and stupid monk . It 's as though Enter the Dragon had never been made , with the plot being a poor imitation . Worth watching once for the fast paced fight scenes , but so stupid sometimes that it hurts . If this was intended , then fine . Thumbs up , however , for recreating that projector room scene from ' Enter The Dragon ' .  
  Sometimes laughter in the middle of a horror film is a signal of its greatness . I remember the nervous laughter from the audience in the re-release of The Excorcist really nervous laughter . It punctuated just how freaked out we all were watching the voice of Satan coming out of a 12 year old girl . In the case of the 2006 remake of the 1972 cult classic The Wicker Man however , it made me think that this new Wickerman is about as scary as the South Park character , Scuzzlebut , the friendly forest monster with TV 's Patrick Duffy for a leg and a celery stalk for an arm who 's favorite hobby is weaving wicker baskets . 3 years ago a friend of mine in Hollywood told me that he heard that Nicolas Cage was going to do a remake of the film . I started laughing and my friend ( Keith ) got mad at me touting Nicolas Cage as a great actor . I just didn't think that he could pull it off and unfortunately for moviegoers I was right . Gone is the realness , the outstanding original music , the originality , the creepiness and the wonderfully powerful dialogue . Instead we have horror movie clichés , affected acting and changes to the storyline that make any believability fall apart . Like many of the countless Hollywood remakes we have been inundated with lately this feels like we are watching 4th graders on a playground " playing Wickerman " . The original film takes place on a remote Scottish Isle where a Scottish police officer is lured there to find a missing young girl named Rowan Morrison . In the new spin a California cop ( Cage ) is lured to an island of the coast of Washington state by his ex-girlfriend to find her missing daughter . She sends a photo and the missing daughter looks exactly like a young girl he tried to save in a fiery crash not long ago . The crash still haunts him in part because the girl 's body was never found . Yet even after he gets a letter with her picture in it that connection is completely cast aside as he heads north , alone , to help his ex-girlfriend find her daughter . He arrives to find an island full of actors pretending to be the descendants of Wiccans , many of whom seem like they didn't get call backs for roles in The Village . And like The Village it isn't long before you realize there is nothing to be afraid of here . Not even the cloudy eyed blind sisters who speak in unison . I think that the opportunity in Hollywood to make great amounts of money on a film often comes at great expense to the artistry . I think someone like Nicolas Cage who is in so many films these days loses touch with the magic that film can be when it gets to the point where he has a personal chef on the set preparing his snacks . We needed a bad re-make of the Wickerman like we needed yet another ' 9-11 ' movie . I 'm starting to wonder if Nicolas changed his surname from Coppola because he wanted to or because he was pleaded with to do so .  
  A warning to potential viewers : if you are looking for an adaptation of the classic story " The Most Dangerous Game , " look elsewhere . " Seven Women for Satan " only superficially addresses the original work by using the name of Zaroff and having said character murder people . Some of what follows might be considered by some to be spoilers . Or not . Boris Zaroff is played by writer / director Michel Lemoine . Whereas his ancestor hunted men because they were the only prey that were truly challenging , Boris ' victims are usually in a position where they cannot defend themselves . The film rambles from scene to scene with a near-total lack of clarity . The director seems to have totally disregarded pacing and left the viewer with a suffocatingly dull film . A few individual scenes are mildly interesting ( such as a torture rack sequence ) , but as a unit , the film fails to entertain . Viewers who are more interested in an assortment of attractive and semi-attractive actresses in various stages of undress might find the film watchable . Most will probably find their time is better spent watching Mentos commercials . In a side note , the DVD extras included a fair amount of information on the film 's history . Apparently , it was banned for several years in its native France which pretty much ruined any chance it had for widespread distribution .  
  One can only assume that Robert Osborne is contractually obligated to express delight at even the least appealing films in the TCM library as this would explain him extolling the ' virtues ' of this " charming " film during his introduction when I saw this on cable TV . Seeing as any old film on IMDb receives ' classic ' status from a number of fawning amateur reviewers , I thought there was a dire need for a more honest review of this film . This is not your father 's ' Shop Around the Corner ' . For all my quibbles with ' You 've Got Mail ' , it still outshines this as a remake in just about every way imaginable . For those who have seen the original , the flaws will only be all the more obvious . From one of the lamest Meet Cute sequences I can recall seeing ( a sad slapstick attempt at ' humor ' ) , this film gets off on the wrong foot and it never really gets back in step . This ' musical ' only qualifies as one in the sparsest sense of the term . There are a sprinkling of instantly forgettable musical numbers and then there 's Judy singing " I Don't Care " while flailing her arms around as if in a seizure . The Christmas song she sings in the store is probably one of her better numbers here . Miss Garland was wonderful in a number of musical films , but here she seems horribly miscast . The role was originally to have been filled by June Allyson and Judy is definitely unable to fill the shoes of Margaret Sullavan 's old part . Van Johnson also turns in a rather bland performance as a second rate Jimmy Stewart type . The leads never achieve the chemistry of Stewart / Sullavan or even that of Hanks / Ryan . This is a film that knows ( some of ) the notes , but not the music . It doesn't really seem to understand why the original worked and even feels the need to add another possible love interest for Van Johnson 's character to complicate things unnecessarily . The remake 's substitution for the original 's infidelity subplot is a hackneyed plot device involving a priceless violin . It is almost embarrassing to watch and feels as if it had perhaps been lifted from an episode of Three 's Company by someone with a DeLorean and a flux capacitor . It 's really just an excuse for a Keaton pratfall . Even the big resolution scene between the romantic leads is mishandled . After seeing both films , you 'll understand why they called it ' the Lubitsch Touch ' and NOT the ' Robert Z . Leonard Touch ' . Avoid this and rewatch either the original film or one of Judy Garland 's earlier films unless you 're an iconoclast who enjoys seeing a once great star falling down to earth .  
  The movie starts out with some scrolling text which takes nearly five minutes . It gives the basic summary of what is going on . This could have easily been done with acting but instead you get a scrolling text effect . Soon after you are bombarded with characters that you learn a little about , keep in mind this is ALL you will learn about them . The plot starts to get off the ground and then crashes through the entire movie . Not only does the plot change , but you might even ask yourself if your watching the same movie . I have never played the video game , but know people who have . From my understanding whether you 've played the game or not this movie does not get any better . Save your money unless you like to sleep at the theaters .  
  I stopped watching lost at this episode because I thought Ana-Lucia and Libby 's deaths were unnecessary and really depressing . Then I found out that they kept Libby around just to die in the next episode ! Gah ! I can't handle it . I liked this show for the first season , but it definitely declined in the second season , I found Jack and Locke 's little religious feud to be annoying . The deaths of Rodriguez & Watros ' characters was the final straw ! I give this episode a 4/10 , for being the end to my viewing of this formerly great series created by Alias legend J.J. Abrams . I hope his series in the future will improve on this one .  
  Yeah , stupidity ! I just finish watching and I still have bad taste in my mouth . Too much colors , too much unnecessary " addons " to a story , too much stupid characters ( I presume they wanted to achieve comic relief , but I only wanted to cry ) .. too much of everything . Shame to spoil one of divine stories from " Arabian Nights " like this . Childish , naive ( both on a bad way ) and with lot of magic-breaking mistakes , I don't think this could keep a child of five for more then ten minutes . Princess is lovely , but should be tongueless , cause actress don't know how to carry a role . Rest of the cast is even worse .. our " bad guy " is REALLY bad . Shame that the " good guy " is not better . Only light in this dark is , of course , David Carradine , who goes unfortunately deeply down under his level with this , but at least keep his actor / " fighter " skills at top . I 'm still sorry to see him in a thing like this , but glad that I had something to watch in whole charade , so thank you David . Only , ONLY , for him , I give this 2 stars to this fiasco .. I would give more for him , but that would rise final score to entire movie . The rest is so bad , that I would , maybe , like to grade it , but there is no grade lover then 1 here , and I think that would be too much .  
  The same night that I watched this I also watched " Scary Movie 4 , " making for one messed up double feature . Unfortunately for these killer tomatoes they could not stand up to the laugh riot that is the Scary Movie franchise . While I fought boredom here watching jokes that were silly and stupid , brutally dated and brutally bad , the more recent parody had me laughing out loud . How could I desire any more than that . Director John De Bello uses the basic premise that some sort of growth hormone has gone terribly wrong and turned the tomatoes into killers . But his main objective here is to slap around the disaster movie genre that was so big back in the day . The script reeks of stoner humor , and perhaps if you take illegal substances with your movie nights this could be your cup of tea . I , sober , was stuck watching a grown man go under cover as a tomato . And that one joke , that is never funny , where the discrepancy between the Japanese speaking actor and the voice over is also here . Some may giggle , I did not . They even had a Hitler joke that wasn't funny , and I thought all Hitler jokes were funny . The narrative of this film is so splintered ( for no good reason ) that it is nearly impossible to explain . Tomatoes kill people , the government tries to stop it , bad jokes are told . Their aim may have been correct as their targets include the media , consumerism , and paranoia ( three things that still control our lives today ) . Oddly enough the main selling point of this film , those gosh darn tomatoes , really don't make much of an appearance . And when they do , get this , they 're played by real tomatoes . That washed up gimmick did nothing for me as I get very little out of watching a pack of tomatoes devour a body thanks to the magic of stop action camera tricks . There is also a fear of going for broke at work here that prevents this film from being truly funny . The gag of having somebody fall asleep in nearly every scene may please some audience members , but more than likely it will be seen as an invitation to join in the fun . I might also add that there does seem to be some old fashioned human egotism at work here . Man eats tomato and that 's dinner , tomato eats man and that is a worldwide catastrophe . But that is just the way the world works . In the film the produce becomes evil because of genetic modification , but in the real world our produce ( see : Taco Bell ) becomes evil thanks to neglect . And like those evil doin ' green onions this film 's shelf life expired a long time ago . There are a few good chuckles to be had . The last shot was really quite splendid , but it was nowhere near enough to save this moderate stink bomb . I 'm pretty sure there is a good movie buried deep within this concept , but the script needed to be filtered through about a dozen rewrites to get there . And by " there " I mean to the level of " Scary Movie 4 . " * 1/4  
  This movie 's heart was in the right place , no matter where its brain was . " Attack " is basically a spoof a la " Airplane ! " ( two years before the fact - nice going . ) of what happens when vegetables , or in this case fruits , attack . Through all manner of film magic ( stop motion , papier-mache tomatoes on skateboards , reverse filming , people watching off-screen tomatoes , people throwing basketball-sized tomatoes at the on-screen actors ) , the tomatoes do indeed attack everyone in their leafy grasp . Then , it 's up to Mason Dixon ( Miller ) and a group of spies I wouldn't wish on any government 's side to save the day . Of course there 's a meddling reporter ( Taylor ) who pops in at the worst times , dancing and singing Army soldiers , Japanese scientists with dubbed-in voices , some guy dragging around a parachute and a samurai sword .. and oh yeah , the San Diego Chicken before he made it big . The gags here aren't all that great . In fact , you could probably make up better yourself after watching these . Some of the dialogue is inutterably bad ( " Please pass the ketchup " - not something to say in front of tomatoes . ) and as far as " Puberty Love " goes .. well , I can't blame the tomatoes for shriveling up on hearing it . What 's good about it ? Well , I liked the theme song and the beginning credits , and there was a scene with four people on the phone at once that was pretty well executed . .. that 's about it . Three stars . Not a " Killer " comedy , but it tries . Rock on , Peace .  
  There aren't enough gay-themed movies and there aren't enough ` coming out ' movies . Every one is a welcome addition to the genre . Although the production values are high ( the movie ` looks ' good , Matthias Freihof ( Philipp ) looks REAL good in a pair of jeans ) this is a bad one . It is a period piece : gay life under an oppressive regime ( East Berlin , 1989 ) a life that seems 40 years behind the west . In a way we 're seeing our own history ; what it might have been like for gays in the 40 's and 50 's here ( it often reminded me of ` Last Exit to Brooklyn : the book not the film ) . But it is unremittingly depressing and SLOW in a contrived way that evoked an old SCTV send up of Ingmar Bergman . It is so sloppily edited I wonder if the director just didn't hack at random . Yes , it is a miracle that this was filmed and released before The Wall came down and yes , life behind the ` Curtain ' was hard for gay people . A good director could have shown all that without stupefying the audience . A good director would have had me mark this one as one of the great coming-out movies and not one of the misses .  
  This film is the worst film I have ever seen . The story line is weak - I couldn't even follow it . The acting is high-schoolish . The sound track is irritating . The attempts at humor are not . The editing is horrible . The credits are even slow - I would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this waste of film . Don't waste your time even thinking about this attempt at acting .  
  As with the other episodes in this made-for-TV series expanding on the many adventures of the sea legend , Horatio Hornblower 's super human infallibility ruins all chance for suspense . As little Wesley Crusher ruined many seasons of THE NEXT GENERATION , Horatio Hornblower invincibly saves every situation . Each and every clever solution inevitably comes only from the lips of Horatio Hornblower . Immeasurably superior , Hornblower 's main trouble in this movie series seems to be tolerating the many error ridden characters above and below him in the chain of command . A perfect being makes for dull story telling . So superior is our hero , that even those who attempt to help him are powerless to do something correctly unless Hornblower is there to direct and control their every move . What is the sense in telling a story about any person who cannot do wrong and will repeatedly win at everything every single time ? What is the point of watching such a story ?  
  This God forsaken film is about three dumb millionaires who gather a bunch of people to play a deadly game , and the winner gets a million dollars . First of all , the acting is terrible , and the movie makes absolutely no sense at all . It is not scary in the least bit , it is so stupid that it made me laugh , which is why it earned that 1 star . The movie is not violent at all , but is pretty sleazy and focuses mostly on the women 's breasts the whole time , and some of the characters are very annoying and whiny . Plus , the monsters in this movie are so cheesy and fake and not scary that it just makes you want to throw something at the screen . Last , but not least the ending is terrible . I don't want to give it away , in case you actually are strange enough to see this piece of junk . AVOID AT ALL COSTS ! Not Rated ( But should be R ) for Nudity , Profanity , and Mild Gore .  
  Tough guys , sexy women , lots of swearing , and a most unconvincing monster that rises from the depths of a polluted lake . You 'd think " Monster " would be fun .. but it isn't , really . It does star Tony Eisley and John Carradine , however , and in my book that makes it worth viewing at least once . In an interview with " Fangoria " in 1987 , Eisley recalled that Herbert Strock had directed the bulk of the film , but somehow Kenneth Hartford-who only directed the footage featuring his children Andrea and Glenn ( portraying characters named Andrea and Glenn , in a particularly inventive turn ) - received full credit . Considering how awful the end result was , Strock was probably glad that he hadn't been credited ! " Monster " has the look and feel of a mid to late seventies TV movie , which is why I like to leave it on in the background every so often . As entertainment it falls flat on its face , but as a reminder of another age and a vanished type of film-making , it 's very effective . The only thing that 's missing is a car chase .  
  The deceptive cover , title and very small hidden print of Power of Prayer tricked me into renting this movie . It started out really well and pulled me in . I REALLY liked it . Between 1/3 and 3/4 's of it , the film started throwing in things that were not set up and made no sense . My first thought was , " This is not written by someone who knows how to tell a story . " I ended up re-watching parts of the movie , thinking I had missed something . By the time I reached the last 1/5 of the movie , it was all BORING , ANNOYING , RELIGION THUMPING DIALOG that made no sense , said nothing , and was annoying to listen to ; I turned off the sound and did a fast forward to the end . Don't waste your time with this flick . Beware of DVDs labeled Whitlow Films and Level Path Productions . And I 'm a practicing Catholic .  
  I just finished watching this movie . It wasn't ridiculously bad , but I 'm really disappointed with it . I 'm not really sure why someone would make a movie like this . It was marginally entertaining , but I feel like the people making it had a lot of disagreements on what they were making . Monday , the writer was in charge ; Tuesday , the director ; Wednesday , the guy who gets the coffee ; etc . It almost seems like they really wanted to make a couple different movies , but only had the time and money to make one . Someone else commented that the acting was really good , but I 'd have to disagree . Then again , if the actors were able to keep a straight face during the filming , perhaps they 're better actors than I give them credit for . The back of the DVD gives the impression that the movie would be a mystery .. something along the lines of a historical Law and Order or National Treasure . It starts off like that , but then , out of nowhere it takes a turn towards a bad episode of the Twilight Zone , or .. what was that other show that wasn't as good .. A bad episode of The Outer Limits . My main complaint about the movie is that it is just so played out . There 's the evil guy with spiked white hair . There 's the love interest , who , when she first appears , the wind actually blows through her hair . Seriously . Once you realize it 's a Christian movie , the end is also pretty easy to spot . The cinematography was poorly done , especially in the opening scenes - way to put your best foot forward . It wasn't atrocious for most of the movie , but there was the occasional ridiculously bad shot of an old lady , praying , arms up in a dark room while lightening is striking - the sort of thing that just makes you a little bit embarrassed to be watching the movie .  
  I suppose all the inside jokes is what made Munchies a cult classic . I thought it was awful , though given the ridiculous story and the nature of the characters , it probably could 've been a much better ( and funnier ) movie . Maybe all they needed was a real budget . Munchies , as many viewers have pointed out already , is something of a Gremlins parody . Hence , all the references to the movie . The movie begins somewhere in Peru during an archeological dig . An annoying dufus named Paul , aspiring stand up comedian who offers no sarcasm or witty jokes during the movie despite his career plans , is holed up with his dad in the caves . His dad is an unconventional kind of archeologist , searching the caves not for artificats or mummies or anything , but proof of U.F.O. 's . And that 's where the Munchies come into the picture . Hidden in the crevice of a rock is an ugly little mutant that looks like a gyrating rubber doll with a Gizmo voice . They name him Arnold , stash him in a bag , and bring him home so Paul 's dad can finally show proof of extra terrestrial life . Paul , the idiot that he is , breaks his promise to his dad to watch Arnold ( a wager he made with his dad , if he loses , it 's off to community college to get a ' real ' career ) . The creepy next door neighbor with the bad rug , Cecil ( television veteran Harvey Korman ) , wonders what his neighbors are up to . So , he and his lazy son , some airhead hippie type ( who looks more like they should 've made his character a biker or heavy metal enthusiast ) to go and snatch Arnold . Why ? A get rich quick scheme of course . And of course , even Cecil 's son is too dumb to look after Arnold . And after a few pokes and prods at Arnold , he multiplies into more Munchies . This wasn't even a movie that was so bad it was good . It was just plain awful . I was hoping that the Munchies would 've mutated and killed the morons that were always after them , even Paul and his girlfriend . At least it would be one way to get rid of all the bad acting in this movie that really hams up the movie . Not to mention poor special effects that look like hand puppets . And really bad writing all around-it wasn't even funny-not even that young cop who can really give you the homicidal twitch in your eye . Like I said , Munchies , if they had been given an actual budget and better actors , they might 've been able to pull off a good parody . Pass .  
  From the decrepit ranks of the already over-saturated ' Hillybilly Horror ' sub-genre comes this woeful tale of a vacationing family terrorized by inbred rednecks . Sound familiar ? Well it most definitely should to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the horror genre . There is absolutely new here . The film seems content to recycle all thee old worn out clichés ( deformed hicks , a peaceful family turned gun-toting killers when push comes to show , the rebellious daughter , the one ' freak ' who 's good at heart , etcetera .. ) , but does even that half-heartedly enough to make this an utter waste of time . This is forgettable dreck , but humorously enough lead J.D. Hart once starred in a movie called " Films that Suck " earlier in his career , quite an ironic omen indeed . My Grade : D-  
  I rented it because the second segment traumatized me as a little kid . I snuck downstairs really early one morning , started watching HBO , and The Raft ( segment 2 ) terrorized me good . This time around , I still enjoyed The Raft , although I couldn't tell whether it was for nostalgic reasons or if it was actually a good short . The other two segments were complete trash . I can't believe a producer somewhere payed to make this junk . All I 've accomplished by watching this was to ruin one more childhood memory . Creepshow 2 will now join Rad among my list of tainted childhood classics . 4/10  
  I love B movies .. but come on .. this wasn't even worth a grade .. The ending was dumb .. b / c THERE WAS NO REAL ENDING ! .. not to mention that it comes to life on its own .. I mean no lighting storm or crazy demonic powers ? Slow as hell and then they just start killing off the characters one by one in like a 15 min time period .. and i won't even start on the part of the thing killing the one guy without its head .. and then you don't even get to see what Jigsaw even does with his so called " new jigsaw puzzle " .. Unless you have nothing better to do .. Id watch paint dry before Id recommend this God-forsaken movie to anyone else .. oh and to make it even better the other movie totem you can see the guy throwing the one creature in the basement scene from the window .. that was funny as hell and probably the only good part of watching that waste of film  
  " Rois et Reine " is a sprawling mess of a movie which will probably irritate as many viewers as it delights . It focuses by turns on ex-lovers Nora ( Emanuelle Devos ) and Ismael ( Mathieu Amalric ) as they each confront a major crisis in their now separate lives . While Nora 's story is played straight and is sombre in tone , Ismael 's is played mainly for laughs , although it 's not particularly funny . Nora 's crisis is triggered by the terminal illness of her father Louis ( Maurice Garrel ) , and Ismael 's by his sudden incarceration in a mental hospital at the instigation of a mysterious third party . Ismael and Louis are just two of the males who have shaped Nora 's life , and in turn have been shaped by her , the most notable others being her now deceased first lover Pierre and their young son Elias . As events past and present are played out for the audience , and the ex-lovers become involved in each other 's lives once more , it gradually emerges that Nora 's personal take on her life story may be less reliable than first meets the eye . Cult director Arnaud Desplechin has fashioned a considerable oddity here , one which has garnered major plaudits in France . He wilfully eschews established narrative convention and develops the movie via a series of dramatic shifts in mood and tone . Had this approach been founded on a coherent unifying core idea or theme it might have worked , but it 's not clear in the end what exactly Desplechin 's film is actually about . Heavy-handed allusions to Greek mythology and Freudian theory are evidently freighted with meaning but , at least for this unschooled movie-goer , remain less than helpful in illuminating and interpreting the lives of the characters . At other times the treatment lapses into kitsch but the use of the anodyne " Moon River " as the film 's theme tune suggests this is probably deliberate . * Spoiler alert * I suspect a major theme of the movie is the not very original observation that how we see ourselves can differ radically from how others see us or even how we think others see us . This idea is most obviously represented in the film by the violent death of Pierre and the revelation contained in Louis ' secret diary , but unfortunately both events seem entirely disconnected from what has otherwise been revealed to the audience of Pierre and Louis ' respective relationships with Nora . This seems a cheat on Desplechin 's part , as if he is thrusting the idea upon us in unmediated form rather than illustrating it more subtly in the natural course of the narrative . One or two darkly surreal touches imply the presence of an alternative but largely unconscious world of persons stripped frighteningly bare , but again these are felt more as pretentious intrusions of film-making technique rather than eruptions from a deeper reservoir of truth inherent in the story . In fact , for all its heavy-handed hints at depth , the characters are curiously undeveloped and unnuanced , as if they function more as ciphers for their creator 's many ideas about people rather than as real people in their own right . Much of the detail of their lives seems arbitrarily applied rather than organic . For example , Ismael , as we are constantly reminded , is a viola player , but more than two hours pass before we actually see or hear him play , and the effect of his chosen instrument or profession upon his personality is never elaborated . Hence , he may just as well be a marine biologist or a trapeze artist . Amalric brings a certain manic charm to the unhinged but ultimately sane Ismael , but I found Devos cloying and monotone ( which may be intentional , however ) as the elusive Nora . Meanwhile Jean-Paul Roussillon as Ismael 's father , Elsa Wolliaston as his psychoanalyst and Magalie Woch as the psychically wounded but defiant Sinologist he befriends in hospital make the biggest impact amongst the supporting actors . Catherine Deneuve 's in it , too , though her role is little more than a self-referential cameo . Ultimately , " Rois et Reine " is very much an acquired taste . Should it fail to push your buttons , it 's very likely that Desplechin 's undisciplined and florid approach will frustrate and exasperate even as you somehow keep watching .  
  OK , the movie is good but I give it a 1 because the idea of a computer virus becoming an organic virus is pure fairy tale . This kind of crap just adds to those uncomputer savvy moron 's paranoid delusions that a computer virus is exactly like an organic virus . First of all , strings of code and dozens of 1s and 0s add up to computer virus . An organic virus is much more complex , even though it 's way tinier . Though , it 's considered one of the simplest forms in the universe , organic virus 's attach burrow into your cells and attach themselves to the RNA , then change your own RNA code . Explain to me how something like that could be processed from a monitor ? Maybe the radiation has some effect on the user 's cornea that turns your eyeballs into these viruses ? I could see that , but obviously , the writer didn't think of that .  
  Good Deaths . Good Mask . Cool Axe . Good Looking Girls .. But Watch Out ! No Plot and Little Scares Completely lower it 's Standards . They Tried to make an " I Know what you Did Last Summer " , but ended up making A " Scream " . But Hey , What do people Expect From a Horror Movie ? Answers Totally Vary . Rent It If You Want , but I Regret Ever Seeing It .  
  This su * k ! Why do they have to make movies that they must know su * k from the beginning ? I mean , look at Alien from 1977 . If the movie you´r about to make is not better than anything made billions of years before , why make it ? I had problems with the plot and who the main character was . That 's not good either .  
  I had high hopes for this film , since it has Charlton Heston and Jack Palance . But those hopes came crashing to earth in the first 20 minutes or so . Palance was ridiculous . Not even Heston 's acting or Annabel Schofield 's beauty ( or brief nude scenes ) could save this film . Some of the space effects were quite good , but others were cheesy . The plot was ludicrous . Even sci-fi fans should skip this one . Grade F  
  The original was a good movie . I bought it on tape and have watched it several times . And though I know that sequels are not usually as good as the original I certainly wasn't expecting such a bomb . The romance was flat , the sight gags old , the spoken humor just wasn't . This may not have been the worst movie I 've ever seen but it comes close .  
  What an absolute pile of pants . Having read Chris Brookmyre 's books religiously since I came across " Quite Ugly .. " , I was delighted to find out that this drama had been commissioned . I obviously had too much faith . Nesbitt is probably the best thing in this show - and even he doesn't quite fit . How anyone can read the book , and then adapt it to this piece of dross is beyond me . Entire characters are changed , situations are dropped , and to see Parlablane 's dramatic break-in reduced to Nesbitt doing a quick chin up and sliding open a bay window .. it brought tears to my eyes . I dread to think what 's going to happen with " Country Of The Blind " if this is the benchmark .. Please , just avoid it ..  
  The long list of " big " names in this flick ( including the ubiquitous John Mills ) didn't bowl me over to the extent that I couldn't judge the film on its actual merits . It is FULL of stereotypes , caricatures , and standard , set scenes , from the humble air-ace hero to the loud-mouthed yank flyer . The music track was such that at one point , about an hour before the end , I thought the film was over : loud , rising crescendo , grand flourish and finish then silence , but then the movie continued ! I found no real storyline , haphazard writing , but smartly-pressed uniforms and the pretty Jean Simmons ( pre-nose job ) with a rousing little ditty . I cannot say that this picture has any of the ingredients which make a film great . I found it maudlin , mawkish and minor .  
  Mary Lou is a slut whose spirit seeks revenge on those who let her come to her fiery doom back in 1957 . Well , the movie mainly takes place in 1986 . The movie falls into the 80 's trap of weird / stupid special effects , including some weird demented looking rocking horse . Anyway , Mary Lou 's spirit does bad things to people and tries to take over one person 's body . Whether or not she succeeds , you 'll have to watch to find out . Anyway , the movie is largely boring and based around a bunch of worthless characters . This also isn't really a sequel , the only thing in common with the first is the name of the high school . It has the avg . horror flick fall backs , gore , pointless nudity , knocks against the catholic church . Basic stuff , boring movie . The acting is decent enough to give it a 3 out of 10 . You can waste your time doing something else .  
  OK , here it is : " Nazi mountaineer befriends the Dalai Lama . " What we do is , first we get a major star with no idea whatsoever how to do a Germanic accent , and we let him flounder around between French , German , American , and British for over 2 hours . Then we concoct a series of wildly improbable events and space them apart very widely , so that the plot inches along almost imperceptibly . But just to make sure the viewer doesn´t fall asleep , we throw in details which are shockingly absurd , such as our hero smoking a cigarette at an altitude of 22,000 feet . Naturally , we must also remember that our target audience does not want to read too many subtitles , so we have every character , even the lowliest peasant in the forbidden closed-off city of Lhasa in 1943 , speak perfect English , also with dubious accents . Of course , the trickiest part is how to handle the spiritual and political aspects of the story , so what we do is this : we have the Dalai Lama befriend the now-reformed Nazi because the latter is so good at fiddling with film projectors , radios , antique cars , and any other devices with represent the freedom of the capitalist west . In return , our hero learns from his young protegé a kind of vague , undefined Buddhism which is never really brought out or treated in a serious fashion . We also have lots of scenes with the hero flaunting all the marks of respects and protocol which the rest of the Tibetan society accords the Dalai Lama , even as we pretend that the hero has deep and profound reverence for these people and their spiritual leader . In other words , we just expect the audience to believe that this guy is now a Buddhist , sort of , in his own way , even though we ourselves don´t seem to know what his transformation entails or how far we want it to go . And last but not least , we hang a statistic onto the end of the film about how appallingly the Chinese have treated the Tibetans ( which is certainly true ) , thus opening ourselves up to charges that we have made a " political " movie , even though it is nothing of the sort . So , zat ist my idea . Vat do you zink ? Can ve make zis movie ?  
  First , it takes a full half hour to get Hackman out of jail and to start doing the job . What a waste of time , we all know Hackman is getting out to do some job for his masters , why waste almost a third of the movie on these sequences . Then Hackman stays in a hotel and the story arc again goes nowhere , simply proving to us that Hackman is under close watch and anything he says or does is know by the masters . Again , another 20 minutes . Then more wasted time showing the reunion with his wife . All of this should have taken 10-15 minutes at most simply as a set-up for the real action , intrigue and plot twists . By the time the real action gets going , I was so bored that I just wanted the movie to end . Hackman is great as usual , and the other actors as well , but this is a dud of the first magnitude .  
  I ordered the movie from Korea because I was an extra in it and was interested to see how it turned out . Having watched it I can say that I am ashamed to have had any part of it . I feel embarrassed not only for myself but for everyone else who had any part in the making of this mockery of British " comedy " . From beginning to end the film is predictable , tedious , dull , monotonous and cringe-worthy to the point that on several occasions I actually looked away from the screen in dis-belief . Until you actually see the movie it is difficult to conceive how un-romantic and un-comedic a romantic comedy can be . It 's not only a bad story , but a badly-made film . In one scene , you can actually see a runner or assistant director showing the S.A. 's when to wipe across . I will post details of this in the ' Goofs ' section . On the up-side , it did fill me with emotions ( disappointment , rage , embarrassment )  
  ( First of all , excuse my bad English ) Of course only a movie starring Jessica Simpson can include serious goofs like this .. I 'm a norwegian and I felt offended and shocked the makers of this movie did not take the time to do their research upon making this American / " Norwegian " movie . Even Wikipedia is more accurate when it comes to facts about this country . So I 'm posting my corrections out of my frustration : - The Country is named Norway , not Norwegia . - " Da " is Russian , not norwegian . - Norwegian priests never use those black capes with that white paper by the neck as the protestant church is the dominant by far - It 's true we have a native traditional folk-outfit ( that we only use like twice a year ) but the outfit in this movie is more like a German outfit . -I could NOT understand the so called " norwegian " in this movie .. Jessica was not making any sense .. neighter did the " norwegian priests " The only thing I recognise is the norwegian flag ( and the viking hats , but that 's so stereotypic what people think about norway - vikings ! : O gosh ) Well .. I guess the people who made this film will never read this comment . but at least I cleared some things up and got rid of some of that frustration .. ! I 'm proud of my country and I 'd love if people in the US were less stereotypic and more accurate when they talk about this country . That was all .. Lenge leve Norge ! ; p  
  ET 's obsession with Dannielynn Smith is despicable . Leave the child alone . With all the constant attention she 'll most likely grow up psychotic , depressed or worse . Think of Princess Diana and how she longed for privacy . Now poor little rich girl Ashley Olson just wants to be left alone . No wonder Greta Garbo became a recluse and said " I want to be alone " . How much does ET make off this little girl ? Does ET not have anything better to report on ? I bet there 's lots of people who really don't care what color her birthday cake and balloons were . By the way , I never heard that Anna Nichole ever won any of those court cases over the will and her inheritance . Who is paying for the lifestyle of Larry , Howard and little Dannielynn ? Could it be ET ?  
  If you want to watch a film that is oddly shot , oddly lit , weird stories of these men ( and one woman ) who enjoy beating the crap out of each other , if you want to enjoy a story that goes nowhere of these two guys , one a boxer and the other a gay man , then you should watch this film . After watching this film , I almost felt as badly bruised up and cut up , like the director ( of the film ) himself beat the hell out of me . This is a movie where one is not meant to watch for plot or for great acting , this is a film to gawk at in horror and wonder . A lot like watching an airplane crash or a train wreck . If you want to watch a great movie , a good movie , a " B " movie , or even a mediocre movie , this movie is not it . A warning to all who watch this film , please don't eat beforehand . You might want to puke by the end of the film .  
  After reading all of the rave reviews about this film and a few that give it a so-so . I finally decided to throw in my no cents worth . I agree with most on the point that if it hadn't been for Lauren Lewis and Chris Ferry it would have been a disaster . Filmed in Mariette OH . just north of Dogpatch where all the real talent fled south down I-77 years ago , at least as far as a tank of gas would allow . I did get a chuckle from reviewers who subtly claim that they cerebrate a little better than most by claiming they followed the plot without an inkling of confusion . This wee tale by the Brothers Crook is like an old record with a skip in it . As an American I understand the difficulties Ind film artists have to face . A trip to Romania would have wiped out the budget for sure . Lets face it this whole film was a loop de loop of Claire in the gas station , Claire on the side of the road , Claire under the bleachers , Claire in the house , Claire in the cornfield , Claire at school . Claire here and Claire there . It almost became monotonous and would have if she had not been the best actor in the cast . Josh and Jeff have to make a living but don't write a two page script and turn it into an hour , twenty flick . Before writing another screenplay about dreaming ghosts watch an episode or two of Ghost Whisperer or something and get a little background . All of the cast except the above mentioned and a couple of others were engaged in their first and last film . Also , there is an appearance by co-director Jeff as he is in all his films . Just like Alfred Hitchcock , eh ? One thing the film had going for it is that the cameraman seemed to have a fixation on Lauren Lewis ' derrière . Well , with all sarcasm now satisfied I still recommend the film for the horror buff just to see this young actress in the formative time of her career ( I hope ) and that Chris Ferry has established himself as a villain worth watching .  
  Well .. now that I know where Rob Zombie stole the title for his " House of 1,000 Corpses " crapfest , I can now rest in peace . Nothing about the somnambulant performances or trite script would raise the dead in " The House of Seven Corpses , " but a groovie ghoulie comes up from his plot ( ha ! ) anyway , to kill the bloody amateurs making a low-rent horror flick in his former abode ! In Hell House ( sorry , I don't remember the actual name of the residence ) , a bunch of mysterious , unexplained deaths took place long ago ; some , like arthritic Lurch stand-in John Carradine ( whose small role provides the film 's only worthwhile moments ) , attribute it to the supernatural ; bellowing film director John Ireland dismisses it as superstitious hokum . The result comes across like " Satan 's School for Girls " ( catchy title ; made-for-TV production values ; intriguing plot ) crossed with " Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things " ( low-rent movie about low-rent movie makers who wake the dead ) ; trouble is , it 's nowhere near as entertaining or fun . " The House of Seven Corpses " is dead at frame one , and spends the rest of its 89 minutes going through rigor mortis , dragging us along for every aching second ..  
  I just saw DreamGirls yesterday , and I was REALLY underimpressed . Despite all the Oscar buzz , this is nothing special . Anyone who was really impressed by this film has never bothered to see any of the true movie musical classics . Except for Eddie Murphy 's great musical and dramatic performance , Dreamgirls is just a glorified TV movie with no style or flair . Just a bunch of amateurs singing AT each other ! Now , the first half hour was good , but I was irritated at how Eddie Murphy 's terrific raveup performances were truncated and interrupted by montages . Those were easily the best songs and best performances in the film . And the " rise to the top " portion of the film was the only part of the film that had a consistent point of view or any momentum . The remaining hour and 45 minutes was a formless , rambling mess that was neither realistic nor fantastic enough to be interesting . It was also visually dull and included too many sound-alike tunes . Condon didn't try to turn any of the tunes into big show pieces as I 'd expected they would . Each number in the 2nd half was just one closeup after another of people " singing " AT each other . And the way they shot Hudson 's big " love me " number was criminal ! Condon just shot her stomping around the stage-no drama at all ! God it sucked ! AND note to all involved-that " sing-talking dialog " stuff might work on stage , but it DOES NOT WORK IN MOVIES ( see embarrassing failures of Evita and Phantom ) . All that " I 'll teell youu something Eff-iee ! " crap should have been left on the editing room floor . Those aren't " songs . " Again , the film-except for Eddie Murphy 's amazing performance-was nothing more than a glorified TV movie . There must have been megabucks behind the PR work for this film ! I wonder how much money was spent to give it that pre-release " one to beat " Oscar buzz ? As a whole this film was , except for Eddie , NOWHERE NEAR an Oscar caliber movie ! ( except for Eddie ) I 'd rank it right up there with Grease 2 . BIG disappointment , especially after all the ( very expen$I 've ) hype !  
  I just watched this film 15 minutes ago , and I still have no idea what I just watched . Mainly I think it 's a film about an internet S & M " star " of CD Roms that are about as realistic as flash cartoons online . She 's murdered by someone , which causes her sister and a crack team of 2 FBI agents to investigate the death . The local homicide division of Big City , USA is also investigating , though most of his work comes by the way of oogling the CD ROMs which he claims are as realistic " as the real thing " . I know . Wow . Michael Madsen is the only one in the film that has any kind of credits behind him . He 's in the film for about 15 minutes , and half of that is him banging the main girl for seemingly no apparent reason . I won't even explain the ending , because quite frankly I can't make it out myself . But before the final scene , we 're treated to a 3 or 4 minute montage of everything in the film . Honestly , they could have ran that then the final scene and it would have been the same effect with the cross eyed direction and all . All in all , stay away from this film . I got it because I love bad movies and I love Michael Madsen . I really could have used that 80 some minutes on something else and have been more satisfied . Like , playing that game with a knife where you jab at your hand repeatedly . That for 80 minutes would be much more entertaining .  
  Pere is an idiot , but he is aware about it and acts in consequence . His life is totally boring and he doesn't know how to change it . When his last friend , Nicco , dies . He feels totally empty and he decides to go out to become drunk . When he is returning home , he crashes with a girl that puts advertisements . Although she ignores him , he fells in love and starts to follow her , obsessively . Well the beginning of the film is a bit slow , and can result boring for most people . However , as action begins , it is a little better ( not much ! , maybe , the best part is the 5 minutes of sex ( almost 30 different scenes about it ) that you can see in the middle of the movie ; it is not good for the erothism , but for the funny and unexpected that is the scene . Probably it is the best of the film . Neither the actors nor the directing is good , and the results is a boring film that that can result funny for some people ( not for me ) . All the film is based on absurd situations ( idiot , as the film says ) , that have anything interesting . I like Ventura Pons , but I have to admit that this is not one of his best films ( maybe his worst ! ) , he knows to do it better .  
  This film uses all art-house clichés ( slow pace , long static shots , minimal amount of dialog ) to try to hide the fact that there really is nothing worth watching here : There is no plot to speak of , the characters are dreary ( female lead ) or cliché ( Tersteeghe 's character ) , and they do not ever talk to each other about anything that concerns their rather uneventful lives . The film is centered around a woman who finds out about her husbands adultery . Instead of confronting him , she half-heartedly takes revenge by committing adultery herself . After a fight and a reconciliation with her sister - who knew about the adultery without telling her - she asks her husband to stop cheating on her . They seem to be re-united as a family . Two other story lines - the planned move of the woman 's elderly father with his young wife to Guernsey and the rivalry with the woman 's sister - do not offer any interesting developments . The suicide of a colleague of the woman that seems to set off events in the film is not a subject in itself . For 2005 - or any other year for that matter - this is not enough to make an interesting film . Moreover , what little possibilities for dramatic development there are in the script are not used or are consciously avoided , as when both the woman and her sister mark a particular piece of furniture from their fathers house which is going to be sold because of his planned move . Both sisters want this particular piece and given their rivalry in the past - over much more important things than furniture : men - this could in theory lead to a confrontation . Or the matter could be resolved by one sister giving way to the other . Either way , this would not be a very interesting or original development of the story but at least it would constitute some development . The film clearly sets this situation up ( with both sisters looking intently at each other during the marking and one sister having mentioned she does not want to draw straws ) but it cheats us out of any resolution : the scene simply ends and how this - in itself rather dreary and materialistic - issue is solved , is not shown . Although almost completely absent , the dialog that is in the film is excruciatingly flat and tepid . For example , when during a visit to Guernsey , the 2 sisters address their rivalry it is in a three line dialog that has a childish " yes it is - no it isn't " ring to it . The fight and reconciliation scene with the 2 sisters is completely without dialog - giving a highly artificial , overly stylised and unrealistic impression and considerably reducing its impact . The way the woman finally - finally ! - addresses her husbands adultery in a single line of dialog has to be seen to be believed - and is at the same time completely unbelievable . The husband does not seem to have any noticeable reaction or if he has any , it is not shown . The woman does not mention her own adultery to her husband . The scene showing the woman , husband and their young son asleep on an airliner , watched by the sister is possibly meant as a happy end , but the way the characters addressed the issues of their lives in what went before makes this unlikely . Because of its slow pace , uninteresting story , leaden direction and absurd lack of dialog , I found this film an example of everything that can be wrong with an art-house movie and a complete waste of time .  
  The opening scenes move as fluidly as frozen velveeta . The attempt at dramatic dialogue only makes me wish I had better control of the fast forward control . Vampires are usually portrayed as sexy and intelligent or mangy disgusting creatures . This vampire tries to seduce his prey by imitating a lost puppy . I usually tally a body count , so there was a cat ( which doesn't count ) a bum , a girl who fell out of the sky with a sword in her ( whatever that was about ) and then the plot . Foley artists are respected for using celery to create the sound of a broken arm , but using the sound of biting into an apple for a vampire biting a victim is just plain silly . I liked Warlock , but this movie just stunk so bad that we turned it off , and it was so forgettable we rented it a year later only to turn it off again .  
  This film aka " the four hundred blows " is a mistranslation . Faire les 400 coups " means " to live a wild life . As a French , I 'm stunned when I see the popularity of this good , but by no means outstanding film . 1 . It 's not the first film of the " nouvelle vague " move ; check Agnes Varda 's " la pointe courte " , ( 1956 ) Alain Resnais 's " Hiroshima mon amour " ( 1958 ) , Claude Chabrol 's " le beau serge " ( 1958 ) are anterior . Historically , " les 400 coups " comes after . 2 . The " nouvelle vague " was sometimes ponderous and hard on their predecessors : Overnight , Julien Duvivier , Henri-George Clouzot , Claude Autant-Lara , Yves allégret and a lot of others were doomed to oblivion . THis selfishness and this contempt is typically " nouvelle vague " . You ' ve never heard ( or read ) the great generation of the thirties ( Renoir , Carné , Grémillon , Duvivier already , Feyder ) laugh at , say , Maurice Tourneur or Max Linder . So , thanks to Truffaut and co , some people will never discover some gems of the French fifties or forties ( Duvuvier 's " sous le ciel de Paris " , Autant-Lara 's " douce " , Yves Allégret 's " une si jolie petite plage " and " manèges " ) . THe novelle vague clique went as far as saying that William Wyler , Georges Stevens and Fred Zinemann were worthless ! 3 . " Les 400 coups " is technically rather disappointing : it 's very academic , the story is as linear as it can be , the teachers are caricatures , and the mother Claire Maurier delivers such memorable lines as ( you 've got to be a French circa 1960 to understand how ridiculous it is ) : Well , your father ' s got only his brevet ( junior school diploma ) and , as for me , I 've got only my high school diploma ! You 've got to know , that circa 1960 , hardly 10 % of the pupils had the HSD in France ! Antoine Doinel should have been proud of his mother after all ! She wants him to have diplomas , who can blame her ? 4 . Compared to the innovations of " Hiroshima mon amour " , which features a brand new form , and a new " fragmented " content , " les 400 coups " pales into significance . Truffaut will master a new form only with the highly superior " Jules and Jim " , helped by the incomparable Jeanne Moreau . 5 . The interpretation is rather stiff ; Jean-Pierre Léaud , arguably listenable when dubbed in English , is still decent , but he will soon degenerate into the most affected of his generation . 6 . The topic = stolen childhood had better days , before ( Julien Duvivier 's " Poil de carotte " , Luis Bunuel 's " los olvidados " ) and will have after ( Maurice Pialat 's " l'enfance nue " , Kenneth Loach 's " Kes " ) I do not want to demean Truffaut , his movie is not bad , but , frankly , French movie buffs , prefer " Jules and Jim " " l'enfant sauvage " ( a film honest , true and commercially uncompromizing to a fault ) " l'argent de poche " ( as academic as " 400 coups " but much more funny ) or his nice Hitchcock pastiche " vivement dimanche " .  
  One of the silliest movies of the 1940s , an unbearable haunted house comedy with music starring Kay Kyser . Kyer , orchestra leader and radio-star ( and eternal college fraternity goof-off ) , was sort of the precursor to Spike Jones , hamming it up for his guests and backed up willingly by his merry troupe of musicians . He 's hired to play a birthday party in a gloomy mansion , the kind where poison darts imported from Africa are framed and hung on the wall . The shindig is beset with a creepy judge , a scary professor , an ominous swami , lots of giggly females , and enough bad jokes to fill three Bob Hope pictures . The songs ( by Jimmy McHugh and Johnny Mercer ) are nothing to brag out , and neither is over-confident Kyser , yukking it up with elbow in the ribs material that turns 1940 back ten years . * from *  
  Seeing a photo of a man being attacked by zombies gave me hope that Lucio " Zombi " Fulci might be up to his old tricks . Unfortunately , other than the close ups of a rotting corpse , there 's little to recommend in this story of the murder of a wealthy man and his daughter 's quest to figure out who killed him . None of the characters are appealing and by the time you find out how they did it ( that twist , at least , was cool ) , you stop caring . The only good thing I can say is that it made more sense than Nightmare Concert !  
  This show is not clever . That 's basically what it boils down to . The " original humor " that these writers try to pull off to avoid completely biting off the rest of the worlds bush bashing is just unfunny . In another comment , someone quotes a couple hilarious lines . The standout for me was George H.W. Bush telling the kids they 're not supposed to watch any TV besides Fox News . Wow . I thought the episodes I saw were bad . The fact that this line is a high point for the series is pathetic . My problem with drivel like this sad excuse for political satire is that these folks are getting a second season . I 'm a liberal republican and I know Bush hasn't been a good president . We all do . But that 's no excuse for putting out this utterly poopie waste of time . I place these writers on the same level as the geniuses behind ' Meet the Spartans ' . Their formula , bite off as many already unfunny topical jokes as you can and throw in even worse original material to actually be able to give yourself writing credit . Again , just plain bad . Unfunny , and it just makes me more and more unhappy that crap like this is renewed , but amazing and original shows like Arrested Development are canned after 3 solid seasons . Please don't watch this crap , unless you 're one of those green blooded liberal hippies who think any sentence with the words Bush and dumb is comedic gold . Oh , and the voice of Bush sucks . All he does is slightly emulate a Texan accent , and exhale really hard at the end of his sentences . At least South Park admits the voices aren't accurate . If you want funny political satire , watch Daily Show / Colbert . Or look for any political sketches on Robot Chicken , which is fun to watch , since the stop motion action figure animation is EXTREMELY well done . Look for the George Bush as a Jedi bit on youtube . Priceless  
  Not a movie , but a lip synched collection of performances from acts that were part of the British Invasion , that followed the dynamic entrance of the Beatles to the music world . Some of these acts did not make a big splash on this side of the pond , but a lot of them did . Featured are : Herman 's Hermits , Billy J . Kramer and the Dakotas , Peter and Gordon , Honeycombs , Nashville Teens , Animals , and of course , the Beatles . It is so much fun watching these young acts before they honed and polished their acts .  
  There 's nothing new for me to say : 4 hours of people dying over and over in the same hill . The cast was stellar , but unfortunately the producer / director / editor / God goofed . He should have eaten humble pie ( if not for his own sake then for the men who died in Kargil ) , hired one of these brilliant Bollywood directors , hired a real scriptwriter , hired a real editor , hired a musician that wasn't related to him in some way ( and who seemed to have listened to some bad version of " Apocalypse Now " on some cheap Indian drug ) , hired a real professional crew , thrown away all the fireworks and told a real story . Unfortunately he , like the bigwigs of the Indian Army , made decisions that were terrible for his actors , and terrible for his audience . We all died over and over . Please don't do that again , Sir ! Sushma Kathmandu , Nepal ps : Next time an Indian director decides to glorify the Gurkha regiment , I suggest he hire more than one Nepali to represent the team . Surely there are plenty of Nepali men working in Bombay-last count was 40,000 to half a million .  
  Great CGI effects & a truly Oscar-worthy performance by Gary Sinise as Lt . Dan . Tom Hanks is a one-trick pony in this movie , how he got the Best Actor Oscar that year over Morgan Freeman was a crime . This movie is a pandering treacly love letter to the baby boom generation , with a barely concealed right-wing prejudice , beginning from Forrest 's service in Vietnam all the way through to the " resolution " with Jenny at the end . With that said , though , it is hugely entertaining and an American movie through and through . I found certain parts of this film exceedingly offensive , Zemeckis dumbs down this movie almost to the level of Gump himself . . . maybe that was the point he was trying to make . Watch this film and ask yourself " What is Robert Zemeckis saying about what makes a good American ? " Forrest seems to have made the " right " choices and been at the " right place at the right time " for the last 45 years . Those who are wrong according to the director 's vision seem to pay a heavy price . So is Zemeckis saying that idiocy disguised as innocence and naivety is a patriotic , even AMERICAN quality ?  
  It 's somewhat telling that most of the great reviews for the film on IMDb all come from people who have only reviewed one film in their entire IMDb career and yes you 've guessed it , that film is " Parasomnia " . I 've often suspected suspiciously good reviews on IMDb for what turns out to be an anything but good films as underhand marketing , but it seems fairly transparent in this case . That 's not to say Parasomnia is terrible , but it stops well short of being the good or great film it had the potential to be . On the plus side , it has a great baddie in Patrick Kilpatrick who does a brilliant job projecting menacing and evil , I could easily see him having what it takes to play a truly memorable baddie on a par with Hannibal Lecter . There are some beautiful visuals in the dream sequences , in fact if the film had decided to explore that terrain more it might have been something better . The actual concept of devious misuse of hypnosis is great too . Although I understand suspension of disbelief is necessary for immersion in any good story , it 's the mark of a good story that it succeeds in letting you do that . If you find yourself being annoyed at what you find illogical or just plain silly , then the story is losing you and that 's what kept happening to me with this film . Other reviewers have mentioned this here and I don't want to get into spoiler territory , but I will say the setup at the ending was particularly ludicrous and disappointing , not too mention the varying mental age of a character that is only supposed to have experienced a few years of life . All in all , there is the germ of a great idea here in diabolically misused hypnotism , but sadly this film fails to realise it into anything special .  
  I view probably 200 movies a year both at theaters and at home and I can say with confidence that this movie is by far the worst I have seen this year ( If not ever , however I have not actually seen " Quest of the Delta Knights " yet ) . This movie is just bad joke after bad joke geared to the 13 year old and because I had he displeasure of viewing it on a bus trip I couldn't walk out . Do yourself a favor and skip this one in the rental aisle . The four dollars could be better spent on any movie by numbers produced by Jerry Bruckheimer .  
  but there are not too many of them . Probably the worst " major release " film I have seen in my life . Definitely the worst for this year . There is no point in commenting on the plot , the cast or the acting . The problem is beyond all that . It lays in the absolute stupidity of the annoying kind ( not the funny kind ) of everything that takes place on the screen . I don't know why I gave it a 2/10 instead of 1/10 . Probably , because of Steven Martini . He really did try . Bottom line - 95 minutes washed down the toilet along with a few brain cells . Avoid at any cost .  
  When I first tuned in on this morning news , I thought , " wow , finally , some entertainment . " It was slightly amusing for a week or so .. But we have to face it , these news reporters ( if one can even call them that ) have WAY TOO MUCH " playing around " time . At first , I thought Jillian was a breathe of fresh air . But seriously , this woman has got not the least bit of journalist in her . She is very unprofessional . She keeps on interrupting Steve when he starts informing the viewers about a certain news report . It 's just really become annoying to the point that I can't watch it anymore . Jillian is NOT a good journalist . Hell , she 's more of a celebrity who loves being a celebrity . Hence , she instantly transforms into a celebrity around celebrities whom she 's supposed to be interviewing . She 's not very professional and quite possibly perceives her relationship with celebrities more important than being a rightfully insatiable journalist - and that 's all I can say about her . Also ( disappointingly ) , this show has more entertainment news than necessary news reports about the world , the government , the US , or something that will benefit and / or serve the public 's best interest . They 're too focus on sensationalism that everything they talk about comes off as a commercial product . On the other hand , their field reporters are interestingly tolerable .. I believe " Good Day LA " is for young teenagers and celebrities , and it is definitely not for people who actually CARE about the news . SIDE NOTE : ( I 'd really rather watch KTLA . However , they try so hard to be entertaining sometimes . They 're still a bit dull though . Oh well , I 'll stick to NBC 's " Today . " ABC 's " Good Morning America " is also okay .. as long as Diane Sawyer doesn't become way too serious . )  
  I had to stop watching this film ( a pseudo-intellectual product for pretentious film viewers ) twenty minutes into it because it was mediocre and dull enough to inspire yawns , not to mention that I was soon near tears over the $ 3.99 I had wasted at Blockbuster . Joanna Pacula 's acting and her awfully rendered Slavic accent are sufficiently terrible to set one to gritting one 's teeth . I knew that two hours of her would be two hours too many . Both Breuer and Nietzsche are played by unremarkable actors of strikingly few talents . While we 're on the topic of talent , Breuer 's supercilious assistant appears to have been pulled out of a local acting troupe . She clearly has not learned her craft . In fact , she 's really quite awful . All the public scenes looked staged , with the extras walking mechanically about in their Sunday best . Turning this film off was far more satisfying than turning it on . Don't rent this terrible movie . You will be sorry you spent your money .  
  I still can't believe how bad this movie was . If I wasn't a massochist I don't know if I would have survived the viewing . It looks like it cost about $ 1000 to make , but it wasn't the money that brought them down . The acting was horrid - not just bad , 3rd graders could have read the lines better . Second , the only other reason to watch this kind of movie is the skin , and that is sorely lacking in this flick . We don't even get to see the more attractive chicas in the buff . Ahh well , better luck next time eh ?  
  The only redeeming quality of this film is the actual storyline .. Otherwise , this movie was terrible . The acting was ridiculously bad , and the set design was cheesy and very tacky . The story was decent , but it was very hard to watch due to all the horrid acting . I wouldn't recommend watching this one .. The only redeeming quality of this film was that the actors were somewhat attractive .. Especially Ryan Bauer , the man who plays the soap opera star . Some of the editing was well done , but there are continuity errors all over the place .. I 'm just starting to get sick and tired of watching gay movies that are bad .. Can we get a good one soon ?  
  .. and not in a good way . BASEketball is a waste of film in all most every single way . It is offensive to all the senses . This doesn't necessarily bother me , I 've seen plenty of bad movies , really bad movies before and will see them again . BASEketball though is a caliber film where you regret wasting ninety minutes of life sitting through it . The reason BASEketball offends me is that it stars Trey Parker and Matt Stone in a film they didn't write . Any respect I had for David Zucker has long since depleted . His recent spoof films are lazy messes that look and feel as if they were made by pre-pubescent boys snickering at penis jokes . " Airplane " was a revolutionary and very funny comedy , watching BASEketball you will be amazed to discover that they were made by the same person . I have so much respect for Trey Parker and Matt Stone . These men are the funniest and smartest comedians in mainstream entertainment today . Their pictures and South Park episodes are as relevant as they are funny . Every joke even the fart jokes have intelligence behind them . It 's easy to forget that there is a mature way to approach immaturity . I imagine BASEketball was a major growing experience for them because they hate the film for all the right reasons . It is a stupid mess with no sense of dignity or class . Parker and Stone have essentially whored themselves out . The film plays like a 90 minute episode of Family Guy . Parker and Stone have never been great actors . They 've been serviceable in their films . I can't really find a way to describe their performance in BASEketball , other than the fact that it feels like they are spoofing a spoof film spoofing a spoof film . Every line is delivered in such a silly winking way . It 's like they are trying to make fun of the worst of these type of pictures and yet they become them in the same way . I am reminded of the South Park episode " How to Eat with your Butt " where Cartman sits in a movie theater watching a gross out comedy with no plot or plausibility except to gross out , Parker and Stone use the same voices they did in that scene for this entire picture . Really it 's sad . And yet that is not my problem with BASEketball . My biggest gripe with the picture is that I sit there knowing that Parker and Stone are knowingly following this piece of crap script . I know that if they took the damn thing and rewrote it that this could have been salvaged to the point of being watchable . There isn't any indication that Zucker let them improv scenes either . Parker and Stone are merely tools to a bad director . BASEketball has some funny concepts and I think Parker especially if he were allowed to take Zuckers script could have elaborated on them more . Instead we get potty humor . Don't rent BASEketball you can get the same laughs watching a group of grade schoolers joking around  
  there are those movies that are bad they are funny , then there are those where you scream " i want that one and a half hours of my life back " .. thats pretty much what this is . dean cain tries to be an actor but fails . the sfx are really bad ( repeated scenes and rocks that look like falling paper ) and the fake plastic guns that have torches taped on them .. the split screen effect used to show multiple things happening at once is just terrible . this movie cant even be used as one of those simple night entertainers , its just that bad if i could go negative ratings , i would  
  When this film plays on television you might want to save about 90 minutes of your time and change the channel . There 's nothing special here that you need to see . Story is about two married couples from Arkansas who go on a trip together to Reno . Couple number one is Lonnie Earl Dodd ( Billy Bob Thornton ) who is a car dealer and having problems with his marriage . His wife is Darlene ( Natasha Richardson ) and she has a low self opinion of herself and they haven't been intimate in a long time . Lonnie has been sleeping with Candy ( Charlize Theron ) who is the wife of his best friend Roy Kirkendall ( Patrick Swayze ) . They all drive to Reno and the four of them stay in one luxurious suite . Roy and Candy have been trying to have a baby and finally Candy discovers that she is pregnant . But Roy phones his doctor in Arkansas and finds out that he 's sterile . Candy and Lonnie admit their affair and now the whole trip is in chaos . This film is directed by Jordan Brady and he 's made a few other low budget films but this is his first with a cast this impressive . Unfortunately Brady doesn't show much comedic flair but you can't lay all the blame on him . This script is just not funny and one of the glaring problems is that the characters are all written down to a sitcom level . Just because they 're all from the south doesn't mean that they have to be naive and idiotic . Thornton 's character doesn't have the sophistication to tip the bellboy more than a dollar . And Swayze 's character is called stupid and dumb by everyone throughout the film and one of the rare good moments comes when he asks everyone to lay off of him for at least one day . Penelope Cruz pops up as a prostitute and it 's a totally worthless and pointless cameo . She barely speaks more than 3 or 4 lines ! I think she was fulfilling an obligation to Harvey and Bob Weinstein who are executive producers for this film . The only person who actually isn't to bad is Richardson . We watch her become more confident in herself but this plotline in the film is very obvious and cliche . All of these actors should know better and it 's hard to figure that they all read the script and liked it . It 's a complete waste of time for these actors but at least they got paid . As for the viewers , your not getting paid so skip this one !  
  The fact that most of the budget for this presumably went on the heavy-duty cast list shouldn't have mattered if it had been staged with flair and imagination and some sympathy for the original 's satirical intent . Instead we get risibly bad song and dance sequences featuring picturesque beggars and whores , and the final alienation is accomplished by pulling back to reveal the action has taken place on a music-hall stage , appropriately enough for a production that 's more Lionel ' Oliver ' Blair than Brecht . The acting talent is shamefully misused : Migenes and Walters are good but don't have to try very hard : Migenes at least has a great voice and some feel for the material . Julia looks perfect as Mack , but struggles with the character , straitjacketed by a fake plummy accent . Harris 's Peachum is embarrassingly mannered and Polly is atrocious . The adaptations of lyrics , script and music are often awkward : it was a bad move to base the film on Marc Blitzstein 's bowdlerised Broadway version , but at least his words were singable , unlike most of what 's been interpolated in gestures of faithfulness . And the attempt at overcoming the low budget by filming at claustrophobic angles on mist-shrouded sets lit in garish blues and oranges as if by some bargain-basement Vittorio Storaro fails utterly - the film just looks cheap , shoddy and thoughtlessly made . Disgraceful .  
  If you enjoy films like American Pie , Road Trip & Van Wilder ; avoid this cinematic refuse at all costs . It is an unamusing , mean-spirited , insipid waste of resources that should never have been discussed aloud ; much less actually recorded and sold to unsuspecting consumers . Easily the worst film I have seen in the past 18 months ; mind-numbingly bad for the entire 86 minutes of it 's runtime . Had it been much longer , I would not have been able to write this review without using profanity . Consider yourself warned !  
  Well , I just ordered this on my pay-per-view at home because I was bored and needed a laugh . I have to admit , I did chuckle a few times , but I don't even remember what parts they were at . I don't understand why this movie was made . It claims to be a comedy but seriousuly , I don't find a singing penis , or a naked 70 year old woman very funny . This movie was trying to fit itself into the ' gross-out ' comedies of recent years such as American Pie and Road Trip , but it just failed miserably . It was way to much gross-out then it was comedy . Also , why on earth did Cameron Diaz attach her name to this movie ? ! ? ! The only thing I liked about this movie was when Dave and Angela were in the pool . I thought it was sexy and enjoyable and well-done . Besides that , avoid this movie . 3/10  
  .. or maybe it just IS this bad . The plot is a cheap rehash of the first , which is weird , since it 's supposed to be a prequel , not a sequel . Pretty much the entire movie seems like a cheap remake of the first , with scenes mimicking the things that happened in the first , only a lot more ridiculous and unlikely . Where the first had a great cast , this one consist of B-list actors and rejects . The acting is mostly horrendously bad . Half of the good lines in the movie are taken directly from the first , as is nearly every major character , including the ones who weren't in the first movie . I realize this was made up by a TV series pilot episode , but that 's no excuse . They didn't have to turn the ( bad ) footage into a movie . Only one thing is marginally good , and that 's the erotic sequences . However , as these are nowhere near as good as the ones in the first , even this isn't raising it above a rating of 1 . If you have a chance to see it for free , and you 're a straight guy , it could be worth checking out , if you want something erotic that isn't porn . If not , avoid at all costs . 1/10  
  .. for one of the worst Swedish movies ever .. forgive me for being dull . First of all i haven't seen the first one ( i was bored that 's my reason for watching the 2nd before the 1st one ) , well i hope the first one is better than this , it was filled with weird cut scenes and very strange plot changes , For the people that have seen this and think 4/10 is high ( belive me so do i ) , but it made me laugh a few times , because it was so bizarre so bad and i still laugh thinking of the punk that came up with this idea , what 's next " Det sjunde inseglet II " . Sequels not based on novel or book doesn't turning out great to often , and this is a perfect example of one . OK i 'm gonna be honest with you : i did laugh a bit , it got a few decent jokes in it and slapstick humor . But don't buy it , rent it . Just let some other idiot do it or download it . 4/10 This movie will be remembered and the director is probably laughed out already ..  
  Just watched this after hearing about how bad it was and wanted to see for myself . Seriously , even if you read all the negative comments on here you will be nowhere near able to comprehend how awful this film actually is , although it has to be one of the most hilarious things I have ever seen ! Never bothered to post a comment on here before , but this piece of crap really warrants it . Firstly the entire plot is ridiculous and nonsensical . Brother of the lead character ( either Ben or Arthur , I forget which is which , and frankly it 's never very clear ) wants to stop some kind of gay marriage by killing everyone in sight - because homosexuality is abhorrent to Christians , but apparently mass murder isn't . Then there 's some other crap thrown in about one of the gay couple 's ex-wife trying to force him to remarry her at gunpoint . This leads to nothing , but provides us with one of the funniest lines of dialogue in the whole " film " - " I don't make sense ? You don't make sense ! That 's who makes sense ! " . Brilliant . Then there 's the acting , which is just atrocious . It must be seen to be believed . My personal favourite is the apparently stoned civil rights lawyer woman , who is clearly reading her lines off of something , yet still managing to mess them up . Enough said . The gay couple couldn't be less convincing . There 's the vaguely attractive and completely gormless guy , and his boyfriend who looks like that little cartoon dough man of the bisto adverts . Only fatter . And less talented . The " film " has also been filmed by someone who is incapable of holding a camera even remotely still , and the number of mistakes throughout is amazing . The whole thing kicks off with the fat main guy in bed with a pair of boots on . Yep . But anyways , we all know how terrible this thing is , so I 'd like to highlight some of the most priceless comedy moments that the " film " provides . - When the fat guy sets the church on fire and then prances like a six year old girl across the car park to make his escape . Hilarious . - Mildread ! No idea what relation she is to the main characters - sometimes they know her , sometimes they don't , but she pops up in a couple of scenes nonetheless . Hilarious . - The stoned lawyer . Already mentioned her , but she 's so funny she 's worth another mention . - The evil brothers dinner of crackers that he lays on for his guests . - The evil brother 's anti-gay potion . - The evil brother 's cats . - The ending , which I won't give away because it MUST be seen to be believed . I warn you though , make sure you 're not eating at the time ! The tub of lard main character / director / producer gets naked . It 's foul . Basically , Ben and Arthur is indescribably bad , but unintentionally the most comical thing you 'll see for a long time . Literally , nothing is good about this excuse for a film , the goon of a director even manages to make the opening credits into a joke by writing his own name about 15 times .  
  Ok , first of all , I am a huge zombie movie fan . I loved all of Romero 's flicks and thoroughly enjoyed the re-make of Dawn of the Dead . So when I had heard every single critic railing this movie I was still optimistic . I mean , critics hated Resident Evil , and while it may not be a particularly great film , I enjoyed it if not for the fact that it was just a fun zombie shoot-em up with a half decent plot . This however , is pure crap . Terrible dialogue , half-assed plot , and video game scenes inserted into the film . Who in their right mind thought that was a good idea . The only thing about this movie ( I use the term loosely ) that I enjoyed was Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Kirk ( Ugh ) . While his name throws originality out the window , you can see in his performance that he knows he 's in a god awful film and he might as well make the best of it . Everyone else acts as if they 're doing Shakespeare . And very badly I might add . Basically the only reason anyone should see this monstrosity is if you a . ) Are a huge zombie buff and must see every zombie flick made or b . ) Like to play MST3K , the home game . See it with friends and be prepared for tons of unintentional laughs .  
  There are some movies you just know they are going to be bad from frame one . Even if you were totally oblivious of Ed Wood 's work , one look at that commentator from " Plan 9 from outer space " and you just KNOW you are not gonna see the next cinematic masterpiece . Just like that , when I saw the first shot of Uwe Bolls masterpiece " House of Dead " , with that guy sitting at the front of the house starting his introduction while trying desperately to sound like he just arrived from Sin City , I knew I 'm in for a helluva ride . So , the movie starts like this - first the lead character says that everybody else is going to die . You know , to keep you wandering . Then he starts introducing the rest of the characters with lines like " Karma .. thinks she 's Foxy Brown " or " Alicia .. my ex .. we broke up recently .. I had to study and she had to fence " . No , I 'm not kidding . Anyway , this bunch of 20-somethings who couldn't act their way out of a wet paper-bag are going to the " Rave of the century " , rave in question being a few tents , a port-a-potty and a shoddy stage located on small island in the middle of the Pacific . Our gang missed the ferry , but thankfully will find a way to get there , the way being a fisher-boat ran by Kirk ( Cpt Kirk ? Get it ? Man , whoever wrote this script is a genius ) and his sidekick who is a bastard child of Simpsons ' Cpt McAllister and that hook killer who knows what you did last summer . To make the long story short , the gang gets to the island , finds nobody there except some bloody T-shirts and then decide to run the hell away from there . No wait , they do not , they actually get all happy and like cos there 's free booze . With that scene the movie hits rock bottom and then against all odds proceeds to go further downhill . Some guys in rubber suits start running around , there is some screaming and shooting , our gang goes to some house to meet some other gang , they go out of the house , meet Cpt Kirk and some police woman ( who between them have about 500 pounds of weapons ) and then decide to go back to the house . Somewhere along the line they transform into a S.W.A.T. team , enter the Matrix , the rubber-suit guys start multiplying like bacteria and I start to cry because I actually paid to see this . To add insult to the injury , every few minutes there are shots from the video game this crap is based on and there is a cute game-over cut-scene for a few characters when they die . I seriously hate this movie . It doesn't even fit in that famed " So bad it 's good " category . It 's just plain bad . The script is bad , the zombies are awful , there is no tension , lines are bad , actors are bad .. the list just goes on . You will probably want to see this movie just because of its reputation of being awful . Don't . There are bad movies that deserve to be watched . This is not one of them .  
  One wonders how the script came to be written . Wayne and the other performers do an OK job but as it is neither comedy , romantic thriller or anything else it is all rather disappointing . One feels as if one of the threads had been pursued it could have been something worthwhile . It is nonetheless interesting to see a real turkey of a story made just before the USA became directly involved with the war . I wonder if the surrounding politics had something to do with trying to make a movie for all tastes but ending up with something that pleases no one . Nonetheless it has historical value .  
  I caught this movie at a small screening held by members of my college 's gaming club . We were forewarned that this would be the " reefer madness " of gaming , and this movie more than delivered . Tom Hanks plays Robbie , a young man re-starting his college career after " resting " for a semester . What we , the viewer , find out as the movie progresses , is that Robbie was hopelessly addicted to a role-playing game called " Mazes and Monsters , " a game that he gets re-acquainted with after a gaming group recruit him for a campaign . This movie is laughable on many , many levels . One scene features the group " gaming by candlelight , " which is probably the best way I can describe it . While I 'm sure that this was meant to be " cultish " in some way , as most gamers know , it 's horribly inaccurate . Most role-play sessions are done in well-lit rooms , usually over some chee-tohs and a can of soda . The acting , while not Oscar-caliber , isn't gut-wrenchingly awful either . This is one of Tom Hanks 's first roles , and Bosom Buddies and Bachelor Party were still a year or two over the horizon . The supporting cast , while not very memorable , still hand forth decent performances . Mainly the badness lies in the fact that it was a made-for-TV movie that shows the " dangers of gaming " Worth a view if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night .  
  I didn't even know this was originally a made-for-tv movie when I saw it , but I guessed it through the running time . It has the same washed-out colors , bland characters , and horrible synthesized music that I remember from the 80 's , plus a ' social platform ' that practically screams " Afterschool special " . Anyhoo . Rona Jaffe 's ( thank you ) Mazes and Monsters was made in the heyday of Dungeons & Dragons , a pen-and-paper RPG that took the hearts of millions of geeks around America . I count myself one of said geeks , tho I have never played D & D specifically I have dabbled in one of its brethren . M & M was also made in the heyday of D & D 's major controversy-that it was so engrossing that people could lose touch with reality , be worshiping Satan without knowing , blah blah . I suppose it was a legitimate concern at one point , if extremely rare-but it dates this movie horrendously . We meet 4 young college students , who play the aptly named Mazes and Monsters , to socialize and have a little time away from mundane life . Except that M & M as presented is more boring than their mundane lives . None of the allure of gaming is presented here-and Jay Jay 's request to take M & M into ' the real world ' comes out of nowhere . It 's just an excuse to make one of the characters go crazy out of nowhere also-though at that point we don't really care . Jay Jay , Robbie , Kate and Daniel are supposed to be different-but they 're all rich WASPy prigs who have problems no one really has . But things just continue , getting worse in more ways than one . The low budget comes dreadfully clear , ( I love the ' Entrance ' sign and cardboard cutout to the forbidden caverns ) Robbie / Pardu shows why he 's not a warrior in the oafiest stabbing scene ever , and the payoff atop the ' Two Towers ' is unintentionally hilarious . Tom Hanks ' blubbering " Jay Jay , what am I doing here ? " made me laugh for minutes on end . Definitely the low point in his career . Don't look at it as a cogent satire , just a laughable piece of 80 's TV trash , and you 'll still have a good time . That is , if you can stay awake . The majority is mostly boring , but it 's all worthwhile for Pardu 's breakdown at the end . At least Tom Hanks has gotten better . Not that he could go much worse from here .  
  CQ could have been good , campy fun . But it commits the only unforgivable sin : it is b o r i n g ! The pace is deadly slow and the plot is fairly confused and so artificial that it 's next to impossible to care where it 's going . The story would have been acceptable in a creative writing class from a thoughtful and sensitive eighth grader but this video should have carried a warning label : " CAUTION : Student film . Fit for viewing only by relatives of the film maker . "  
  This film is exactly what you get when you really over stretch your abilities , it 's like someone who has just passed there driving test and then pitting them in a formula 1 Grand Prix ( not I might add , the US Grand Prix as everyone might pull out due to dodgy tyres and you might just win ) , that is how far short this film falls . Now don't take this the wrong way , I love B-Movies , around half my collection is made of B-Movies but I don't think there are enough letters in the alphabet to describe how bad this film is . First of the story ( for a B-Movie ) isn't that bad , it has potential there to make a B-Movie brand , were not talking Friday 13th potential , but potential none the less . But what really lets this film down is the acting , at not one second do I believe anything , it 's like watching QVC except the presenters on QVC tend to have a heavier tan . In summary I 'd like to say I 've seen worse films , but I can't .  
  For some reason , various young couples hiking through the Italian Alps split up to see who can reach their campsite designation first . James ( Gregory Lee Kenyon ) enters a cave , finds a skeleton of an ancient demonic gladiator and becomes possessed by the spirit of " Tyranus " when he puts on a helmet belonging to the corpse . He then spends the rest of the film running around in the woods hunting down his friends and hacking off their limbs to add to some stew to bring the undead " Demonicus " back to life . This shot-on-digital Full Moon release is stupid , senseless , has terrible acting and sound and the ( Los ) Angeles National Forest is a poor substitute for Italy . However , it 's pretty high on the unintentional laugh scale thanks mainly to the overwrought lead performance . Whether bug-eyed running around in cheap-looking armor brandishing a sword or spouting neurotic Latin gibberish about demons and resurrection , Kenyon 's ridiculous facial expressions and awkward line delivery must be seen to be believed . Oh well , at least he 's not boring like most of the rest of the cast .  
  If I hadn't read his name on the DVD cover , I never would have suspected that this rather gushy and old fashioned musical was made by a man so closely associated with the French New Wave . In fact , the film is so far from that , that I wonder if back in the 50s and 60s , New Wave auteurs would have absolutely hated this type of film-it 's so .. so .. unreal . And , it seems to have little to do with so many of his previous films . This isn't necessarily a bad thing-just a very surprising thing . What I also found a bit surprising was the amount of praise some of the reviewers gave this film-especially when there are so many better French musicals out there . The songs in this film were simply not particularly interesting and the characters all seemed so bland and stereotypical . If I had to see another rich person who fretted about how hard it is to be rich or get a good sale price on a designer outfit , I was going to puke . The bottom line is that like American musicals , not every French musical is gold . This film is not another " Les parapluies de Cherbourg " ( UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG or " Huit Femmes " ( EIGHT WOMEN ) and despite the presence of Audrey Tautou , I can't see much reason to recommend it as anything other than a dull oddity .  
  The banner says it all , this is one really bad movie , which is sad because I normally like Sheffer , and I have been impressed with Andrea Roth in other roles . This , however , is terrible . I wont waste any more time .. its just that bad .  
  Really , I can't believe that I spent $ 5 on this movie . I am a huge zombie fanatic and thought the movie couldn't be that bad . It had zombies in it right ? Was I wrong ! To be honest the movie had it 's moments .. I thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it . Overall I think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again . The movie could have been better if we could see some boob but I had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that . Buyer beware .. unless you are into masochism .  
  this movie was definitely the worst movie i 've seen in my entire life , and i 've seen some pretty bad movies . i didn't like the way this movie was filmed . all of the actors are unknown , and it looks as though a bunch of friends got together and decided to film their own movie . but it 's absolutely horrible . i 've never seen a worse movie . the story is so fake , and i just found that it took a really long time to get to the end of the movie . there was no plot , it looked as though it wasn't planned out before they started filming . the story is too weird . i didn't like how slow it took to get to the point of the movie . there was no point in even filming this movie . if you 're considering watching this movie , don't . you 're just wasting your time .  
  Some kids are hiking in the mountains , and one of them goes into a large tunnel and discovers some old mummified gladiator . He puts on the gladiator 's helmet and spends the rest of the movie killing all the other hikers . This thing is just so utterly senseless it 's maddening . Here 's a short list of things that don't make any sense : 1 ) A guy and a girl are in their tent and they think they hear something outside . The guy goes out to investigate and finds another hiker outside . Then he hears his girlfriend scream so they head back to the tent - arriving the next morning ? ! ? He was only 50 feet away ! 2 ) These two dunderheads then hear another girl scream ( What , 100 feet away ? ) , but don't investigate because they 're afraid they 'll get lost . 3 ) Another guy and a girl are walking around , and in about their 10th scene together the girl informs the guy that due to the circumstances , protocol no longer requires him to address her as professor . I mean , what the .. ? First off , that 's just a really stupid thing to say , secondly he never called her professor in the first nine scenes they were in together . 4 ) A wounded girl attacks Demonicus and he stops her , telling her that part of his gladiator training taught him how to wound without killing . Um , yeah , we kinda noticed she 's wounded and not dead because she 's up and walking around . But , thanks for that tidbit of information . 5 ) One girl is tied up in Demonicus ' lair , and when someone attempts to free her , she instead instructs this person to go and get help . Um , look , idiot , if she set you free , which would take about 5 seconds , there would be no need to get help . And it just goes on and on . The whole middle part of the movie is spent with the two idiots getting lost in the woods , then they fight , then they pitch a tent and ignore the screams of their friends , then they wander around some more . It 's just so damned boring and pointless that I turned the DVD off halfway through . None of these characters are sympathetic , especially the ones that get the majority of the screen time . Demonicus himself made me laugh out loud every time I saw him - he looks like a kid in a Halloween costume , scrunching his face up to look evil . He runs , or should I say scampers around like he 's gay . The special effects are comedic , the acting is for the most part awful , and nothing makes any sense . Overall , maybe this concept could have produced an enjoyably campy film if they put some more time and effort into it , getting rid of the ludicrous dialogue , creating characters with actual likable personalities , having some sort of logical flow to the action , and maybe even making Demonicus a female character in a sexy gladiator outfit . But no , instead we get this senseless pile of nonsense that will bore you to death .  
  This film was terrible . I have given it the high score of 2 as I have seen worse , but very few . From the clichéd start of having the end of the film at the start and going back to the start at the end this film used everything in the box of tricks used in film making just for the sake of it , like a kid with too many toys . There was the endless , boring repetitive narration , slow motion , freeze frame , flashbacks and merged images etc - none of which made a dull film any better . It is called " 16 years of alcohol " , but there was little drinking or drunkeness and no depiction of withdrawal with the film jumping about all over the place with no coherent sense . The story was badly written and extremely pretentious and the direction was equally poor and it is a shame that people have put up further money for more films by Mr Jobson , previously know for being in a rubbish group and on TV making as much sense as this film does . I found it a major struggle to see this to the end but in the hope of it getting better I carried on to the bitter but it really was a waste of time and I would have been better off not bothering .  
  Macy , Ullman and Sutherland were as great as usual . Ritter wasn't bad either . What 's her name was as pretty as usual . It could have been a good movie . To bad the plot was atrocious . It was completely predictable , trite and boring . From the first 15 minutes , the rest of the movie was laid out like a child 's paint by numbers routine . The characters were stock pieces of cut out cardboard . There was nothing new or interesting to say and that completely outweighed the acting , which was a pity . Finally , too bad the script writer wasn't the victim . Especially with the " precocious " lines from the child , which were completely unbelievable . Again , it 's only the acting that prevented a much lower score .  
  Watching a videotaped replay of about 8 various 1994-1997 Spider-man cartoons made me realize why I couldn't stomach it when it first came out . I 'm from the old school , where the 1967 Spider-man cartoon was the best and still remains the best . ( I won't get into the psychedelic version which is terrible - give me traditional villains please . ) The acting in the new stuff is lousy , read off a sheet with either no feeling or overacting . Paul Soles , where are you now ? This guy was the best at voice acting for Spider-man . No one comes close . Watching Secret Wars , a great idea for a cartoon mini-series , made me wince . Dr . Doom sounds like a comedy version of Bela Lugosi . In a scene with Red Skull and Doc Ock , Red Skull has no German accent while Ock is heavy Russian ! The old Marvel comic hero series from 1966 had much better voice acting . Iron Man sounded like he was wearing an iron mask , Captain America sounded authoritative not like some teenage kid . Paul Frees as the Thing in the 60s was the best Thing ever . The old voice actors were pioneers and there will never be anyone like them . Ever hear Mel Blanc 's son ? No way can he replicate his dad . The animation is clunky . Okay , so they have all the fancy character shadings and nicely painted backrounds . Sometimes you can say more with less movement if more movement looks bad . Sometimes when you let the computer take over the movements they become robotic . I really don't think any of these animators know what in betweeners are . The stories are badly written , and some of the lines they give the heroes are horrible . Why , for example , when heroes are teamed together for the first time they start fighting with each other ? In Secret Wars , it was a lame excuse that got them in disagreement . I can see if the hero was dark , unknown and mysterious - like the Punisher , but why the Thing and Iron Man can't hold their tempers with each other is ridiculous , then the Torch joins in . This is just another of the later comic trends to get heroes to square off at each other for a few seconds because ' everyone ' wants to see that stuff . Give them a better reason to fight and maybe it can be pulled off , but " Hey what are you doing here " and " You don't tell me what to do " are LAME reasons . Another badly written scene is in The Wedding where Harry Osborne unmasks himself to spoil Peter 's wedding . That whole scenario was awful . Last , but certainly not least , is what another critic calls Juvenile Violence - meaning no punches at all . In Secret Wars , the Lizard carefully ducked the Thing 's charge . But the Thing punches the bad guys across an entire block in the comics . He must simply revert to lifting heavy things and subduing a bad guy by grabbing hold of him in the cartoons . Sure , these cartoons were not made strictly for us adults but for kids under 12 . That 's why they can't have punching , because mommy and daddy don't believe in that type of violence . But you can blow things up , these cartoons will include that . As a kid before political correctness came in fashion I saw cartoons punching each other . What 's wrong with a punch to the chops ? Is there really less violence in the world today because those slick and crafty new cartoons took out the punch ? I find this the most insulting of all when I watch the new stuff . They 've written out " the punch ' because we could all hurt ourselves . Kids , enjoy these cartoons all you want , I 've seen enough . 3/10 rating  
  Okay guys , we know why we watch film like " The Invisible Maniac " ( just look at the cover , man ! ) . T and A all over the place ( with a lot more T than A ) . But .. shouldn't there be a story to go with it ? " C'mon , " I can hear you say - " this is just girls gettin ' naked ! Who needs a story ? ! " Well , if this were called " The NAKED Maniacs " , I wouldn't have a problem . But since these guys are cribbing from " The Invisible Man " , they need to have a bit of story hereabouts , you know , to keep your mind busy . However , all they can muster up is how this crazy doctor creates an invisibility serum and , when he cracks , uses it to spy on naked women and ends up killing a lot of teenagers . And when you see the smarmy-looking teenagers he goes after , you 'll be grateful . One star , for the T and A , but there 's a little too much gore for you skin fans , so proceed with caution . TIDBIT - yes , it 's THAT Savannah .  
  It 's interesting that all who ( so far ) seemed to like this film had no expectations-I guess that 's the trick . In contrast with them , I had optimistic expectations , and that was a mistake . As soon as I saw how close to the faces the camera always was , I knew we were in the hands of an extremely amateur director-that 's always a clear sign of them , they think it is arty or effective or intense to hold the camera about two inches away from the actors . The actors in this film , though , had only one facial expression each . If the close camera wasn't enough , the lack of light in the film killed it . The film seemed to be entirely filmed in the dark . So now we know that the cinematographer was a rank amateur , as well . " Ooh ooh , we 're going to light the set with a flashlight ! That will make it all seem intimate ! " No , that made it all seem invisible . On top of the serious technical flaws , there was absolutely no story beyond the barest hint of an idea that was never developed , and nothing new about this kind of relationship was illuminated . ( Perhaps this is a new kind of film for Germany , but in Los Angeles , forget about it . ) The fact that this film won a couple of film festival awards doesn't indicate the quality of the film , but besmirches the quality of these particular festivals . I can assure you that this film won't win anything in the festival where I saw it . In fact , two times during the film it seemed that it was finally over and people started to get up to leave ( this was one of the side effects of the cinematographer 's " total darkness " technique ) . But when the film shuddered on , instead , there were moans coming from the audience . And once the movie finally DID end , it was clear that it hadn't mattered if it actually had ended at either of the two earlier points . An earlier ending would have saved the audience from yet more monotonous scenes of domesticity ( folding sheets , cutting vegetables , spreading honey on bread ) . Yeah , we get it , the life of the lonely old man was boring - but we figured that one out at the very beginning . I recommend that audiences miss this one , it has absolutely nothing to offer sophisticated movie-goers .  
  I bought this movie for $ 5 at a used CD store , and I kinda regret it . I 'll start by saying I 'm a huge fan of cheesy horror flicks . They provide a horribly tacky cheap entertainment . This movie entertained for the first half hour , because it was so bad it could be made fun of in an MST3K style manner quite easily . Then it got boring . The acting is the scariest part of the movie . While great acting is not to be expected , this was laughably bad and , honestly , provided all of the entertainment that was to be had . This is the plus side to the movie . Where the movie really falters in entertaining is the writing , lighting , and the editing . This movie provides way too many " What the % $ @ # is going on ? " moments . There are many moments , such as the mother having strange fits at dinner , and then that having absolutely no consequence in the movie . Along the lines of dinner , someone in charge decided it was fun to watch people eat refined food for five minutes straight without dialogue every time a meal was served . During the meals and other inappropriate moments , the scene cuts away to pure darkness outside . Then cuts back in . And speaking of darkness outside , one of the funniest parts of the movie is the climate , where apparently it isn't nighttime unless it 's raining . And speaking of darkness , a big problem with the movie is that it 's so poorly lit you can't see what 's going on half the time , which is more of a frustration than anything . In one of the climactic scenes , you can't even tell what you 're supposed to be seeing that 's so shocking . And when it comes to climactic scenes , Unhinged contains one of the worst . I 've seen people say " Wow , that surprised me , and that 's good . " I can say that the big reveal did surprise me , because I didn't see it coming . The reason I didn't see it coming is because it made absolutely no sense . I won't ruin it for you , but I will tell you that my friend and I spent a good twenty minutes rewinding to various parts of the movie to find anything that would have validated that at all , and all we found were more things saying that it wasn't possible . All in all , this movie is actually better when you watch it with the commentary tracks that make fun of it . I love crap horror movies , but this was too much .  
  If you liked the Grinch movie .. go watch that again , because this was no where near as good a Seussian movie translation . Mike Myers ' Cat is probably the most annoying character to " grace " the screen in recent times . His voice / accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with an awful weasing sound , which is about the only laughing I heard at the theater . Not even the kids liked this one folks , and kids laugh at anything now . Save your money and go see Looney Tunes : Back in Action if you 're really looking for a fun holiday family movie .  
  I 've been trying to track down this film just by googling bad phrases about " teenagers seduce and kill man in his house " and such . I think I first saw parts of this film when I was about 10 years old when it was running on cable . It made quite an impression ! It 's the kind of film that kids know they shouldn't be watching , and switch the channel when their parents come in . When I saw who the cast was , I couldn't believe that some of these good actors were in such a horrible movie . Then again , if you like to see men who cheat on their wives get murdered , then this is an interesting film . Also , if I recall , there 's some pretty interesting pseudo-lesbian moments . Probably the dumbest ending of all time , but still .. memorable .  
  Let 's face it - if you rented a STDVD sequel of a forgotten 80 's gem , and expected it to be better than the aforementioned , then you are an idiot . Wargames : The Dead Code joins the long running list of unnecessary sequels that the DVD market has filled so easily . Movies like this don't need spoilers , because YOU already know them . The " plot " for this " film " , is as follows : Nerd meets girl ; girl likes nerd ; nerd likes girl ; nerd gets accidentally involved with Top Secret Government computer ; nerd and girl go to another country ; nerd and girl end up being persecuted by Government suits in the other country ; nerd and girl meet some important old guy that dies at key point in the " film " ; nerd and girl are captured ; the Top Secret Government computer gets crazy ; nerd is hired to beat Top Secret Government Computer ; nerd beats Top Secret Computer by using the same old Top Secret Computer from the first Wargames " film " ; nerd saves the day ; nerd gets laid . The end . The acting , script , effects , score , and cinematography are what you would expect - B-grade . Some familiar faces are in here , and unless you are a mega fan of Colm Feore , then you should avoid this one . Granted , the movie won't make you insane enough to eat your own toes by seeing it , so if you like cheap looking STDVD sequels , then you are right at home . Sadly , Mathew Broderick was too involved with some " masterpiece " , that he couldn't even do a five second cameo in this one . But can you blame him ?  
  Impenetrable rubbish . This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen . The dialogue is ghastly , the horror effects are laughable . The only thing that kept me watching was the ever-splendid and totally underrated Michael Cule .  
  Oh dear . I was so disappointed that this movie was just a rip-off of Japan 's Ringu . Well , I guess the U.S. made their version of it as well , but at least it was an outright remake . So , so sad . I very much enjoy watching Filipino movies and know some great things can come out of such a little country , so I can't believe this had to happen . Claudine and Kris are such big names there , surprised they would be affiliated with plagiarism . To any aspiring movie makers out there in the Philippines : You do not have to stoop this low to make money . There are many movie buffs that are watching the movies Filipinos put out and enjoying them !  
  In Hollywood in the 1930 's and 1940 's , I think that every studio can make a western , except Warner bros . The few times they try , it always ridiculous ( except , perhaps , for They Died with their Boots on - which is a cavalery western . ) I have read that Humphrey Bogart , seing James Cagney with this big cowboy hat on his head , said that he looks like a mushroom . True ! Cagney and Bogart are too urban , too XXe century to be credible in a western movie . The story here had no suprise , and it did't help . Every 10 minutes , I figure I can see Bogart and Cagney drops their little guns and put hands in a machine gun to get away from the set in a 1930 's black car .  
  Three years ago , Rachel ( Therese Fretwell ) was partying at the lake with her friends when her brother falls out of a boat and drowns . Rachel 's friends think it is time for her to stop beating herself up and taking blame for something she had no control over . So grab the brew and something to chew and head back to the same lake that has been in Rachel 's constant nightmares . As expected , a bloodbath has already started when two of the friends are splattered before even heading to the party . This flick has the feel of a high school play where everyone forgot their lines and ' winged it ' .. very badly ! Writer Marcos Gabriel gave himself the meatier role as Rachel 's boyfriend Leo . Outside of Fretwell and Gabriel there are some pretty lame acting and a few characters you would like to choke the crap out of before they get ' offed ' . Giving attention to a few more players that had the nerve to appear : Erin Gallagher , Andrew Williams , Jasmine Trice and Derek Nieves . This is one MEMORIAL DAY you wouldn't mind missing .  
  I have an awful pan-and-scan videotape of " Boom ! " , and I want to see it in all its widescreen glory . So I voted " 1 " and hope you will too . Together , we can pull this movie down into the pits of cinematic dross , and hope that someone will see an opportunity for BIG MONEY in releasing " Boom ! " in its Director 's Cut Extended Version . The movie is one of my howling favoritesyou just look at the people involved , the director , the actors , the cameraman , and you say to yourself , " Yep , I guess you can fool some of the people for a lot of time . " Producers considering the DVD release of " Boom ! " should note that , everywhere it 's been shown , there have been sellout crowds in the theaters . But it hasn't been up to Frostbite Falls yet .  
  I just wondering what is the purpose of making movies like this ? the profit ? and to whom they are referring what intelligence must use your brain to watch something like this crap ? This movie is watchable by under 3 years old children if you are adults don't try to watch it . Thats the reason i think Hollywood started to use cartoons in movies with actors like this you must forget the art of cinema , be sure that you ll have tons of pop corn to consume for time to pass till this movie ends also get many cola 's hamburgers your laptop your cellphone this movie can be used easily in a restaurant but for sure not in a theater , my dog who is always next to my family when watching a movie left the building . The sure thing is that this movie is referring to people with no demands from the cinema art . The only thing that this movie can be used is for watching it when making the supermarket shopping list . I am giving 2 stars for supporting the India 's cinema efforts but for nothing more or less ..  
  First I liked that movie . It seemed to me a nice comedy with some silly moments . The costume designer Albert Wolsky did his best ! The same as wonderful set decorator Robert R . Benton - this man really had a very good taste ! But the script writers disappointed me extremely . The best ending would be the scene on the ladder , but instead of it , they decided that the father and his daughter should be together . Don't like the ending . The father becomes boyfriend of his own daughter and his ex-wife knows about it and finds it alright . It would be OK , if the scriptwriters would for example say that now there is a different soul in the body , but they did not , they only deprived him of memories . The actors were good , they were really funny . Cybill Shepherd was charming , Robert Downey Jr . was very funny in the dancing scene : ) ) ) .. But some of the moments spoil even the impression of good acting . For example , Corinne Jeffries , played by Cybill Shepherd after the death of her husband was waiting for him 23 years ( it 's a long time ! ) , she was true to him , she loved nobody but him , and when she met him and was just about making love to him , after a scene with her friend Philip Train ( Ryan O'Neal ) , she very easily betrayed the man she was longing for so many years ! It would be a good movie , if not the ending and some missed human psychology .  
  This Book-based movie is truly awful , and a big disappointment . We 've been waiting for this move over a month . Many film reviewer were hopeful for it . Also in newspapers and TV , it made big sense . When 29th April comes , many people regretfully noticed that movie is really awful . Why ? First of all story was so monotone . It has been many indefinite scenes , sometimes it 's hard to realize what 's going on . The actresses , out of Hulya Avsar , weren't harmonized with their roles , especially Vildan Atasever . She acts better in comedy films , In this movie , a kind of drama , she couldn't disposed of her previous role . And finally Movie is too short , just 66 minutes .  
  The over-heated plot of " Bonjour tristesse " is taken from a juvenile first novel by Francoise Sagan , which became a best-seller , though God knows why . For teenagers wanting to get rid of a potential step-parent it may have a certain appeal . Don't be taken in by the fact that David Niven plays the playboy father and Deborah Kerr the step-mother-in - prospect . Unfortunately , too much rests on the frail shoulders of Jean Seberg . She 's beautiful and easily fulfills the image of a spoiled teenager . The problem is that she can strike poses but she can't act . Anyone who saw her as Joan of Arc in Otto Preminger 's St . Joan - Seberg 's first film - knows she was incapable at 19 of carrying a film . This movie , also by Preminger , fulfills the " promise " of the first . It was her second movie ; she was now 20 . What was Preminger thinking ? That Niven and Kerr could compensate for Seberg 's lack of acting capacity ? Not a chance ? Seberg 's character is at the center of the story and , pretty though she is , convincing though she may be physically as a 17 year old , she can't meet the emotional demands of the role . I don't know if she ever became a successful actress in her short life because she did not have an impact on my consciousness in her later pictures . But anyone who thinks this film is better than mediocre needs a taste check . In spite of Niven and Kerr , this remains a juvenile story executed in juvenile fashion by a beautiful young girl who badly needed acting lessons .  
  It 's obvious that the people who made ' Dead At The Box Office ' love B-movie horror . Overt references to the genre are peppered throughout , from stock characters ( the authority figure who doesn't believe the monstrous invasion is really happening ) to Kevin Smith style discussions to reenacting Duane Jones ' last moments from ' Night of the Living Dead ' not once but twice . Unfortunately it takes more than love to make a good movie . The staging and shot choice are unexciting and unimaginative . While a common admonition in film school is to avoid ' Mastershot Theatre , ' telling the story completely in a wide master shot , here we find the obverse as in several sequences it 's hard to figure out the spatial relationships between characters as the story is told in a series of medium shots with no establishing shot to tie it together . Editing is drab and basic and at times there are unmotivated cuts . The lighting is flat and sometimes muddy , making the scenes in the darkened theatre hard to make out ( was there lighting , or was this shot with available light only ? ) . Some shots are out of focus . The dialogue is trite , and the performances , for the most part , one-note ( Isaiah Robinson shows some energy and screen presence as Curtis , and the fellow playing the projectionist has some pleasantly dickish line readings ; Michael Allen Williams as the theater manager and Casey Kirkpatrick as enthusiastic film geek Eric have some nice moments ) . The premise is silly , even for a B horror flick ( Also , it 's too bad Dr Eisner was unaware of Project Paperclip - he could 've saved himself a lot of trouble ! ) . The ' zombies ' are non-threatening , and their makeup is unconvincing ( although the chunky zombie trying to get a gumball out of the machine raised a smile ) . For a zombie fan film , there is very little blood or violence , although what there is , is handled pretty well . The incidental music , while stylistically uneven , is kind of nice at times , and there are some good foley effects . The ' Time Warp ' parody was a fun listen , although the images going along with it were less fun to watch . Unfortunately , the looped dialogue sounds flat . Was this shot non-sync ( doubtful , it looks like video through and through ) ? I watched the special introduction by Troma Films ' Lloyd Kaufman before the main feature - although it consisted essentially of Kaufman plugging his own stuff and admitting that he hadn't seen the movie while someone mugged in a Toxie mask , its production and entertainment values were higher than ' Dead .. ' itself ( quick aside to whoever put the DVD together - the countdown on film leader beeps only on the flash-frame 2 , not on every number plus one more after ) . For that matter , the vampire film theatregoers are seen watching early in ' Dead .. ' looked a lot more entertaining than this . Recommendation to avoid , unless you know someone involved in the production or are an ardent Lloyd Kaufman completist ( he plays ' Kaufman the Minion ' in the film within a film ) . ( Full disclosure : my girlfriend is an extra in this movie . I swear this did not color my review . )  
  The film , a Universal release of a Protelco-MLC production , is a boring retelling of the theory of breaking down the molecular structure of an object , capturing it in a cell as " pure energy , " and then sending it back complete to a " target area . " There is no explanation WHY this is necessary , but Professor Paul Steiner ( played by pock-mocked actor Bryant Haliday , " Devil Doll " ) thinks it 's something to dedicate his , and his assistants ' , Pat Hill ( Mary Peach ) and Chris Mitchell ( Ronald Allen ) , lives to . During an experiment before noted Dutch scientist " Lembach " ( Gordon Heinz ) , his machine fails due to sabotage , so he has himself " projected " by his secretary , Sheila ( Tracey Crisp ) to seek revenge . Of course , she screws up and he comes out looking like a " pork roast " with the power to electrocute people . With this new-found power , he manages to zap some Cockney idiots , a security guy named Latham ( Derrick de Marney ) and his lab boss , Dr . Blanchard ( Norman Woodland ) . He also is able to break into a pharmacy and steal a pair of rubber gloves and a black coat , as well . In the end , though , despite Hill and Mitchell 's attempt to help him , the clown destroys his equipment and himself . On the whole , a completely pointless movie with no message at all . Also one of the most depressing color films you will ever see .  
  I don't hand out " ones " often , but if there was ever a film that deserved this sort of attention , it 's " Gas ! " This is self-indulgent crap that reaches for some of the ambiance of M * A * S * H and falls completely flat on its face in the attempt . I see what Corman was going for - Malcolm Marmorstein and Elliott Gould tried to reproduce Gould 's deathless role in the original movie version of M * A * S * H with a similar plot ( in the movie " Whiffs " - look it up here in IMDb , http : / ww . imdb . com / title / tt0073891 / for more information ) . Marmorstein and Gould got closer to the brass ring with " Whiffs " than Corman did with " Gas ! " but didn't quite get there . Neither one of those films even got close to the success of M * A * S * H . What 's wrong with " Gas ! " ? What isn't ? No one comes close to really acting at a level above junior high school theatrics . The production values stink . Someone else here mentioned the magically regenerating headlights on a getaway car , and there 's more of that lack of attention to detail . Nothing works the way it 's supposed to in this film , and nobody cares . " Gas ! " actually put me to sleep . It 's not a sure cure for insomnia , but really close . On the Cinematic Sleep Induction scale , " Gas ! " falls somewhere between " Last Year at Marienbad " and George Clooney 's remake of " Solaris " ( which itself was remarkable for being more boring than the Mosfilm original , despite that studio 's seeming unfamiliarity with the idea of keeping the audience 's attention by judicious editing ) . Judicious editing would have decimated " Gas ! " to about twenty minutes . The result would be pointless , but no more so than the original film . Certain films are so bad that they have a compelling quality that makes them worth watching anyway . This isn't one of them . Don't waste your time . It 's not even amusingly bad .  
  Mind , my friends and I saw the movie based off it 's title alone . It 's cute , though obvious in it 's plot and direction - you know where the movie is going within the first five minutes . My main contention with the plot is that while it remains tolerably consistent , they never explain a lot of the things behind the characters . An alcoholic father , overworked mother , stressed-out sister .. that 's a bad family , but aside from the occasional mention from the sister , there 's not any resolution . I was also confused as to the scene with the bottles .. it seemed pretty random . The writing is a secondary concern .. the kids weren't bad actors , but their script left a lot to be desired . Unfortunately , what could have been a cute niche movie was pushed aside for a single , blah special effect , lame scripting , and a glaringly obvious plot .  
  This film , for an after school special , isn't that bad , and that 's the problem . Nothing happens . You feel as if you 're still in class . A guy teaches a bunch of young underdogs how to be good paint ball players . We never get to see these underdogs doing badly as the good player is training them . They all of the sudden turn into good players by meditating . Also there are too many characters and no character development . Too much time is spend on the main character and his sexy sister and not enough on some of the other kids . This could have had a ' Bad News Bears ' feel ( the original ) since there was a girl on an all boys team , but there wasn't any feel to this movie at all . It has no feeling and leaves a dull pain in your bones after watching it , is not fun to bag on , not fun to watch , and is just kind of .. there . Plain . Boring . Something you 'd watch after school before your pre-evening nap . As dull as the day is long and it 's been a long , long day watching this movie .  
  Many people here say that this show is for kids only . Hm , when I was a kid ( approximately 7-9 years old ) I watched this show first . It was disgusting for me . I talked with other kids about this and , sure , other shows and know what ? This was the measure of disguise , whenever we wanted to emphasize something 's silliness ( either on TV or anything else ) we said " Uh , just like Power Rangers " and laughed . And before visiting this site I could not imagine that there actually are fans of MMPR . It was so strange for me that I decided to watch it again and try to understand why people like it . I did not enjoy that viewing . But it dawned upon me : maybe I have not enough imagination ? It may be . However this argument is not sufficient for me to rate it more than 1 star .  
  You might be tempted to rent this film because Peter Sellers appears in it . That would be a mistake . This is one of the most pointless films ever made . I kept waiting for something funny to happen , but nothing funny appears in this movie . Even the film industry recognized this was a very weak film and didn't even try to promote it . Its a wonder that it was ever put on video . I wonder what sort of contract caused Sellers to be in this film . I also wonder why the people responsible for this film were allowed to go on to make other bad films . Surely this film is a waste of the money used to create it , and a waste of anyone 's time watching it . Surely there are high school students who would be able to write / produce a film which as a plot .  
  Even worse than the worst David Lynch " confusathon " , " Brain Dead " makes no sense whatsoever . Shamefully wasted talent ( Bill Pullman , Bill Paxton ) , bounce around like they are in a " Tom and Jerry " cartoon on acid . There is negligible character development . It simply starts climbing the " strange scale " , until climaxing in total chaos . Do not get sucked into this because of the above fine actors . They are given nothing to work with , and you will be wondering what 's going on throughout the entire , unbearable 85 minutes . I highly recommend avoiding " Brain Dead " at all costs , unless you are into scattering your brain into total nonsense . - MERK  
  This movie had a IMDB rating of 8.1 so I expected much more from it . It starts out funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous . But before the movie is half-way through , it begins to drag and everything becomes sickingly predictable . The characters in the office were delightful in the first third of the movie , but we get to know them a little too well ; they become caricatures , not real people at all . This is the same story I 've seen hundreds of times , only told here with slightly different circumstances . The thing is , I could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialog weren't so stale ! The only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivations , and unfortunately that was also the case with Dead Letter Office . Hopefully this movie will end up in the Dead Movie Office soon .  
  I watched it with my mom and we were like .. What the hell ? We didn't get it at all . I may have this wrong , but a chair had something to do with the death of this woman 's father . That movie was terrible ! This is not a movie for those who love a good suspense movie . Bad suspense movie ! * shakes cane at movie * I 'm never seeing it again . And I 'm a big fan of lifetime movies , too ! They kinda need to quit trying to make movies outta books . It 's driving me crazy ! And Whit was butt-ugly and yet , she loves him more than Hugh , who was a TINY bit nicer-looking . My rating : 1/10  
  This is Peter Falk 's film . Period . I was 10 years old when this film came out ; I was already a film maven at the time . Of course neither my parents nor I saw this film when it came out , but I was in love with the typeface of its ads & the aura that this was An Important Film . Okay , 34 years later I 've finally seen the film-having never seen any Cassavetes-directed film previously . He 's a hack , overall . Zero sense of timing , editing . Gena 's performance reminds me too much of Dustin Hoffman 's stint in " Rain Man " : technically on par but entirely one-note . As Tom Cruise stole " Rain Man , " Falk takes the cake for this film . I was annoyed with Gena 's performance , really throughout-it seemed better suited for " Awakenings " ( blecch ! ) . It 's not all her fault : she 's a basket case from first scene to last . We never find out why ? But Falk 's character seems real & is performed WONDERFULLY by Falk as a seriously flawed man . Shave off at least an hour ( an editor needed ! ) , and this would have been an arresting portrait not of a woman under the influence but of a simple , Cro-Magnon , man coming to grips with a wife who doesn't work & yet cannot deal with her three kids & her husband 's long hours of work . I 'd rather remember Cassavetes for " The Dirty Dozen " or " Rosemary 's Baby . " He would have been a better director had he snipped his own tendency for excess-as he amply demonstrates with this film . Bob  
  After reading the reviews , it became obvious that everyone intellectualized this work . How utterly boring . Oh how about the good ol ' days and there was nothing like it . Of all the comments no one expressed any emotion to this work or any other . I grew up just after the end of the steam age and this cinematic gem along with Dan'l Boone graced the Saturday afternoon matinées . This was an annual movie that made the rounds and filled the seats with gabbing , yapping , farting , giggling , snot monsters like myself or was-self . And it was a movie theatre filler at the time . Almost as big as the Wizard of Oz . IMDb insists that every critique contains something about the plot . Problem is was that it was rather a template . Here goes . Randolph Scott ( cowboy / hero ) gathers friends and goes defeats those evil people . Hooray ! All of us kids figured out that plot before we plunked our quarter down to watch it . That was just about the plot line of every Scott , John Wayne , Roy Rogers film ever made . If you take the time to go back and review each and every movie - just don't ask for surprises . One must remember the context of the times . There was no or little TV . None for kids . There was school . There was the great outdoors . There were toy guns . No Cyber time . And the steam age had just collapsed . But movies such as this provided the entertainment and filled the imaginations of young whippersnappers . Even the girls got into it . This movie was the entertainment . And it is just as mindless as anything produced today . It had a purpose originally of being propaganda . But quickly came to be kids movies . Our fathers had experienced the real thing . And it wouldn't be until Sam Peckinpah a decade later who finally lavished the red splashes of imitation blood in realistic and copious quantities . Not until his directorship did anyone die slowly , with great pain and miserably . Until Peckinpah war and gun fights were a rather bloodless affair . Thanks Sam . To see a movie had little or no blood , the adults didn't mind . They wouldn't have tolerated it I think . No guts spraying the shattering plant life . So this movie had all of the glory and none of the gory . Gung Ho was suitable for kids then . You will see that I assigned a four to this rating . Why would I do that ? Well . It is a terrible movie . No matter how I love it . I do love this movie because it brought back one of the happier moments of my childhood . But it is not all that good of a movie in quality terms . Basically Gung Ho transitted to become a romance novel for children . Should people watch it . Of course . I am not saying to stay away . Realistically however . The plot is simple . The characters shallow ? they are shoals . You can love a bad movie .  
  This movie could have been so much better with a script rewrite . Not that I expect a great deal of plausibility in movies , but you 'd think that even the homeless and urban-dwelling Jack Mason would question why a group of experienced hunters would want to hire him as a hunting guide . And upon reaching the hunting grounds , poor Ice-T plays his part as if he is actually going to lead these men through woods he 's never seen before . And how does Jack Mason find Thomas Burns back in Seattle ? I 'm assuming this movie was based on Richard Connell 's short story " The Most Dangerous Game . " A few years ago I showed this movie to a class of 9th grade students after they read the story . I reedited the movie , cutting out all the pointless scenes and all the profanity . It ended up being 43 minutes long .  
  People who actually liked Problem Child ( 1990 ) need to have their heads examined . Who would take the idea of watching a malevolent little boy wreak havoc on others and deem it funny ? The movie is not funny , ever , in any way , beginning to end . It wants to be a cartoon , but the writers don't realize that slapstick isn't funny when people get attacked by bears , or hit with baseball bats . It may be funny in cartoons , but not in a motion picture . The film 's young hero is Junior ( Michael Oliver ) who , since he was a baby , has been placed at the front doors of foster parents for adoption . The families reject him , because Junior tends to give them a hard time . He is then thrown into an orphanage , where he terrorizes the nuns , and writes pen pal letters to the convicted Bow-Tie Killer ( Michael Richards ) . He is soon adopted by Ben and Flo Healy ( the late John Ritter and his wife , Amy Yasbeck ) , who are dying to have a child , in order to be just like every other parent in their neighborhood . Junior becomes a member of the Healy household , and " Little " Ben takes an interest in him , despite the fact that he destroys a camping trip by luring a bear onto the site , or throws a cat at his father " Big " Ben ( Jack Warden ) , a bigoted politician . I think that we 're supposed to care for Junior so that we can root for him when he gets his revenge on people . His new mother , Flo , is a bitch , his grandfather is completely selfish , and one little girl-who despises adopted kids-is such a spoiled brat . But what Junior does to get the last laughs isn't funny - - it 's mean , cruel , and sometimes life-threatening . And what is the film 's message ? That kids should resolve problems with violence and vandalism ? That they should seek friendship by writing to convicted killers ? They definitely don't what it 's like to be a bad kid . Junior isn't a one-he 's just a sadistic , little twerp . There used to be a time when it was bad for kids to beat up others . Now , everybody 's laughing when Junior beats up kids with a baseball bat . It 's a shame that this movie has been marketed as a " family comedy . " What 's worse is that Problem Child is rated PG . What was the MPAA thinking when they saw this ? There 's a lot of profanity and mean-spirited pranks here , that one may wonder about the dividing between the PG and the PG-13 . Kids will enjoy this , but parents will be shocked at what is being depicted on screen . And to most people , Problem Child will be considered a " guilty pleasure " classic ; a film that someone will shamefacedly admit to liking , even though the prevailing opinion , as put forth by more serious viewers , is that the movie is a piece of crap .
